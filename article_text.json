Condiments and salad dressings, which exist in a variety of flavors, are often used to enhance a salad. \nGarden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula/rocket, kale or spinach; they are common enough that the word salad alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types include bean salad, tuna salad, bread salad (e.g. fattoush, panzanella), vegetable salads without leafy greens (e.g. Greek salad, potato salad, coleslaw), s\u014dmen salad (a noodle-based salad), fruit salad, and desserts like jello salad.\nSalads may be served at any point during a meal:\n\nAppetizer salads \u2014 light, smaller-portion salads served as the first course of the meal\nSide salads \u2014 to accompany the main course as a side dish; examples include potato salad and coleslaw\nMain course salads \u2014 usually containing a portion of one or more high-protein foods, such as eggs, legumes, or cheese\nDessert salads \u2014 sweet salads containing fruit, gelatin, sweeteners or whipped creamWhen a sauce is used to flavor a salad, it is generally called a dressing; most salad dressings are based on either a mixture of oil and vinegar or a creamy dairy base.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"salad\" comes to English from the French salade of the same meaning, itself an abbreviated form of the earlier Vulgar Latin herba salata (salted herb), from the Latin salata (salted), from sal (salt). In English, the word first appears as \"salad\" or \"sallet\" in the 14th century. Salt is associated with salad because vegetables were seasoned with brine (a solution of salt in water) or salty oil-and-vinegar dressings during Roman times.\nThe phrase \"salad days\", meaning a \"time of youthful inexperience\" (based on the notion of \"green\"), is first recorded by Shakespeare in 1606, while the use of salad bar, referring to a buffet-style serving of salad ingredients, first appeared in American English in 1937.\n\nHistory\nThe Romans and ancient Greeks ate mixed greens with dressing, a type of mixed salad. Salads, including layered and dressed salads, have been popular in Europe since the Greek and Roman imperial expansions. In his 1699 book, Acetaria: A Discourse on Sallets, John Evelyn attempted with little success to encourage his fellow Britons to eat fresh salad greens. Mary, Queen of Scots, ate boiled celery root over greens covered with creamy mustard dressing, truffles, chervil, and slices of hard-boiled eggs.Oil used on salads can be found in the 17th-century colony of New Netherland (later called New York, New Jersey and Delaware). A list of common items arriving on ships and their designated prices when appraising cargo included \"a can of salad oil at 1.10 florins\" and \"an anker of wine vinegar at 16 florins\". In a 1665 letter to the Director of New Netherland from the Island of Cura\u00e7ao there is a request to send greens: \"I request most amicably that your honors be pleased to send me seed of every sort, such as cabbage, carrots, lettuce, parsley, etc. for none can be acquired here and I know that your honor has plenty,...\".Salads may be sold in supermarkets, at restaurants and at fast food chains. In the United States, restaurants may have a salad bar with salad-making ingredients, which the customers will use to put together their salad. Salad restaurants were earning more than $300 million in 2014. At-home salad consumption in the 2010s was rising but moving away from fresh-chopped lettuce and toward bagged greens and salad kits, with bag sales expected to reach $7 billion per year.\n\nTypes\nA salad can be a composed salad (with the ingredients specifically arranged on the serving dish) or a tossed salad (with the ingredients placed in a bowl and mixed, often with salad dressing). An antipasto plate, the first dish of a formal Italian meal, is similar to a composed salad, and has vegetables, cheese, and meat.\n\nGreen salad\nA green salad, or green leaf salad, another name for garden salad, is most often composed of leafy vegetables such as lettuce varieties, spinach, or rocket (arugula). If non-greens make up a large portion of the salad it may instead be called a vegetable salad. Common raw vegetables (in the culinary sense) used in a salad include cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, onions, carrots, celery, radishes, mushrooms, avocado, olives, artichoke hearts, heart of palm, watercress, parsley, garden beets, and green beans. Nuts, berries, seeds, lentils, and flowers are less common components. Hard-boiled eggs, bacon, shrimp, and cheeses may be used as garnishes, but large amounts of animal-based foods would be more likely in a dinner salad.\n\nWedge salad\nA wedge salad is a green salad made from a head of lettuce (often iceberg), halved or quartered, with other ingredients on top.\n\nBound salads\nBound salads are assembled with thick sauces such as mayonnaise. One portion of a bound salad will hold its shape when placed on a plate with a scoop. Examples of bound salad include tuna salad, chicken salad, egg salad, coleslaw, and potato salad. Some bound salads are used as sandwich fillings. Some pasta salads, e.g. macaroni salad, are bound salads. They are popular at picnics and barbecues.\n\nDinner salads\nMain course salads (known as dinner salads or as entr\u00e9e salads in the United States) may contain small pieces of poultry, seafood, or steak.  Caesar salad, chef salad, Cobb salad, Chinese chicken salad, Michigan salad, and Pittsburgh salad are dinner salads.\nA wide variety of cheeses are used in dinner salads, including Roquefort blue cheese (traditional for a Cobb salad), and Swiss, Cheddar, Jack, and Provolone (for chef and Cobb salads).\n\nFruit salads\nFruit salads are made of fruit (in the culinary sense), which may be fresh or canned. Examples include fruit cocktail.\n\nDessert salads\nDessert salads rarely include leafy greens and are often sweet. Common variants are made with gelatin or whipped cream; e.g. jello salad, pistachio salad, and ambrosia. Other forms of dessert salads include regional dishes such as Midwestern America's ambrosia-like glorified rice and cookie salad, which contains crumbled cookies as an ingredient.\n\nSee also\nAntipasto\nList of salads\nSalad spinner\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nFrances Barber Harris (1918), Florida Salads: a collection of dainty, wholesome salad recipes that will appeal to the most fastidious, Jacksonville, Fla: Jacksonville Printing Co., OCLC 509840, OL 6612631M", "summary": "A salad is a dish consisting of mixed, mostly natural ingredients.

It is a localised version of Indian achar. It is known as atjar in Dutch cuisine, derived from Indonesian acar. Acar is usually prepared in bulk as it may easily be stored in a well-sealed glass jar in refrigerator for a week, and served as a condiment for any meals.\n\nHistory\nPickling originated in India around 2400 BCE, and with expansion of Indian cultural influence on Greater India, through transmission of Hinduism leading to Indianisation, and the formation of native Southeast Asian kingdoms which adopted many Indian cultural elements, including food processing techniques.\n\nThrough examining the etymology, the similar sounding name strongly suggests that indeed acar was derived from the Indian achar pickle. Indian achar was transmitted in antiquity to the maritime realm of Southeast Asia, which today is recognized as acar in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, and then on to the Philippines as atchara. The adoption of this vegetable pickling technique possibly took place during the Srivijaya period between 7th to 13th century.\n\nIngredients\nThe Southeast Asian variations are usually made from different vegetables such as cucumber, carrots, cabbage, shallot, bird's eye chili and yardlong beans, which are pickled in vinegar, sometimes with kaffir lime to add citrus aroma, and also dried chillies. Some recipes might have the vegetables tossed in ground peanuts. Acar is commonly served as a condiment to be eaten with a main course, such as martabak, nasi goreng (fried rice), satay, and almost all varieties of soto. Just like common pickles, the sour taste of acar is meant to freshen up a meal, especially fishy dishes such as ikan bakar (grilled fish) or rich and oily dishes such as mutton satay to neutralize the fat.\n\nRegional cuisines\nIn Indonesia, acar is commonly made from small chunks of cucumber, carrot, shallot, bird's eye chili and occasionally pineapple, and marinated in a sweet and sour solution of sugar and vinegar. Some households add lemongrass or ginger to spice it up. It is usually used as condiment to accompany grilled foods such as satay. Nevertheless, acar can also be consumed as a whole, complete dish. For example, ikan acar kuning is a fish dish (gourami, mackerel or tilapia) served in acar pickles of cucumber, carrot, shallot and red chili, mixed with yellow spice paste made of ground turmeric, candlenut, ginger, garlic and shallot. It is known as atjar (pickle) in Dutch cuisine, derived from Indonesian acar, since the Netherlands and Indonesia share colonial ties.\nVariations of Malaysian and Singaporean acar include acar awak or Nyonya acar and Malay acar. Acar awak is more elaborate, containing additional vegetables such as eggplants as well as aromatic spices in the pickling mix.\nThe salad has also been adopted into Thai cuisine, where it is called achat (Thai: \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e14, pronounced [\u0294\u0101\u02d0.t\u0361\u0255\u00e0\u02d0t]). It is made with cucumber, red chilies, red onions or shallots, vinegar, sugar and salt. It is served as a side dish with the Thai version of satay (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e30\u0e40\u0e15\u0e4a\u0e30).\nWith Indian and Malay slaves initially brought by the British Empire, atchar became a favourite condiment in South Africa. The local variation is usually made with green mangoes.\n\nSee also\nAtchara \u2013 Pickle made from grated unripe papaya popular in the Philippines (Philippine cuisine)\nAchar \u2013 Pickled varieties of vegetable and fruit\nThai salads \u2013 Thai cuisine\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Acar is a type of vegetable pickle of Maritime Southeast Asia, most prevalent in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.

Burmese salads are made of cooked and raw ingredients that are mixed by hand to combine and balance a wide-ranging array of flavors and textures. Burmese salads are eaten as standalone snacks, as side dishes paired with Burmese curries, and as entrees. The iconic laphet thoke (fermented tea leaf salad) is traditionally eaten as a palate cleanser at the end of a meal.\n\nIngredients\nBurmese salads are typically centered on one major ingredient, ranging from starches (e.g., rice and noodles) and cooked ingredients (e.g., Burmese fritters and proteins) to raw fruits and vegetables. Common starches used in Burmese salads include rice, egg noodles, rice vermicelli, rice noodles, and potatoes. Burmese salads may also feature raw vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, cabbage, onions, kaffir lime, long beans, and mangoes. Fermented ingredients, including lahpet (pickled tea leaves), ngapi (fish paste), pon ye gyi (fermented bean paste), and pickled ginger, also feature prominently in several classic Burmese salads.The salad ingredients are dressed with various seasonings, including chili oil, garlic oil, and sesame oil, toasted chickpea flour, lime juice, fish sauce, tamarind paste, peanuts, and fried garlic, and then thoroughly mixed by hand. Aromatic fresh herbs like coriander, mint, lime leaves, and green onions are also used to garnish Burmese salads.\n\nList of Burmese salads\nWhile the repertoire of Burmese salads has not been codified, Burmese salads are invariably suffixed with the word \"-thoke\" (\u101e\u102f\u1015\u103a; lit.\u2009'to mix by hand') in the Burmese language.

Atho is a mixture of noodles, shredded cabbage and onions garnished with tamarind, salt, fried onions, chili flakes, garlic and ajinomoto seasoning.\n\nSee also\nBurmese cuisine\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Salads of Myanmar at Wikimedia Commons", "summary": "Burmese salads (Burmese: \u1021\u101e\u102f\u1015\u103a; transliterated athoke or athouk) are a diverse category of indigenous salads in Burmese cuisine.

Cheese slaw is also consumed in some areas of the United States.\n\nOverview\nCheese slaw is prepared using grated cheese, crumbled or cubed cheese, grated carrot, and a mayonnaise dressing. Cheese slaw is very similar to some coleslaw recipes, but is distinguished by the inclusion of cheese. Cheddar cheese is typically used in the salad's preparation, although other cheeses such as blue and Swiss are sometimes used. It often does not contain cabbage, as per coleslaw, although cabbage is occasionally used. Cheese slaw may contain other vegetables, such as chives, spring onions, shallots, parsley, and broccoli.\nIn the United States, cheese slaw is sometimes prepared using blue cheese, and is sometimes used as a hot dog dressing. In addition to the base ingredients, cabbage is also sometimes used in U.S. versions of the dish. U.S. versions have also been prepared using blue cheese salad dressing, instead of mayonnaise.\n\nHistory\nThe origin of cheese slaw has been somewhat disputed. Cheese slaw dates to at least 1939 in Australia, when a recipe for it was printed in the Townsville Daily Bulletin, a newspaper published in Townsville, Queensland. The recipe was for a \"ham and cheese slaw\", and included shredded cabbage, cubed cheese, julienne ham, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and mustard. Cheese slaw recipes were also published in the Australian Women's Weekly, a monthly women's magazine, in 1946 and 1966.Some people claim that cheese slaw originated in Broken Hill, New South Wales. Cheese slaw is found extensively in Broken Hill, where it is served in restaurants, prepared in households, and has been stated to be \"ingrained in the local diet\".  It has been served in Broken Hill cafes and milk bars since the second half of the 20th century. In Broken Hill, it is typically served as a side dish. Some people in Broken Hill top barbecued chicken with cheese slaw, which causes the cheese to melt.\n\nSee also\nList of cheese dishes\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Cheese slaw is a salad and side dish consisting of cheddar cheese, carrot, mayonnaise, and sometimes cabbage.

Several early recipes also include anchovies. A variety of dressings may be used with this salad.\n\nHistory\nFood historians do not agree on the history and composition of chef's salad. Some trace it to salmagundi, a popular meat and salad dish originating in 17th-century England and popular in colonial America. Others contend chef's salad is a product of the early twentieth century, originating in either New York or California. The person most often connected with the history of this salad is Louis Diat, chef of the Ritz-Carlton in New York City during the 1940s. While food historians acknowledge his recipe, they do not appear to be convinced he originated the dish, which is more popularly attributed to either chef Victor Seydoux at the Hotel Buffalo, a Statler Hotel in Buffalo, New York or to chef Jacques Roser at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. Roser worked in various culinary positions in Paris before being invited to become head chef at the prestigious 1920s Hotel Pennsylvania, where he worked for over fifteen years. Seydoux first learned his craft in Montreux, Switzerland, and continued his studies in France and England before coming to work in the United States.Seydoux's first experiences in the U.S. included positions at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and the Ritz-Carlton. Alice Rose Seydoux, widow of Victor, claims that the salad was officially launched at the Hotel Buffalo. When the customers started requesting the off-menu salad made with cuts of meat, cheese and hard boiled eggs, the hotel decided to add it to the menu. Giving chef Seydoux the honor of naming the salad he is purported to have said \"Well, it's really a chef's salad.\"The chef salad probably owes much of its popularity to Louis Diat, chef at the Ritz-Carlton. Cooking a la Ritz includes Diat's recipe, which includes a base of chopped lettuce topped with julienned boiled chicken, smoked ox tongue and smoked ham, then garnished with hard-cooked egg halves and watercress, all dressed with French Dressing. The inclusion of this salad on the menu at the Ritz-Carlton would have introduced the salad to more of the public. It is possible that the inclusion of Thousand Island dressing is also linked to the Ritz, since the hotel also introduced the dressing to New York City. Several other early chef salad recipes mention crumbling Roquefort cheese over the salad.The first known printed recipe dates to 1936 and includes many ingredients found in later recipes, but no meat. A 1926 recipe already includes the garlic-rubbed salad bowl. In a note following the recipe, the author recounts the following story:\n\nWhile passing through a kitchen one day, I found the above mixture in huge bowl in the center of the chef's table, and being friendly to salads as well as cooks, I requested a sample and was served very liberally. The salad was delicious; in fact it was a sort of master composition and deserving of an appropriate name. As nothing but the best of everything enters into the food materials supplied to chef's table, the salad was born and named Cooks Salad.\" I have been more or less successful in ordering this particular salad; but if I wish to get this salmagundy right I order it from the chef\u2019s table and not the salad pantry.

Like tuna salad and egg salad, it may be served on top of lettuce, tomato, avocado, or some combination of these. It may also be used for sandwiches. Typically it is made with leftover cooked or canned chicken. It may also refer to a garden salad with fried, grilled, or roasted chicken (usually cut up or diced) on top.\nIn Europe and Asia the salad may be complemented by any number of dressings, or no dressing at all, and the salad constituents can vary from traditional leaves and vegetables, to pastas, couscous, noodles or rice.\nEarly American chicken salad recipes can be found in 19th-century Southern cookbooks, including Sarah Rutledge's The Carolina Housewife: Or, House and Home (1847) and Abby Fisher's What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking (1881). Rutledge details a recipe for \"A Salad To Be Eaten With Cold Meat Or Fowl\" that explains how to make a mayonnaise from scratch, before adding it to cold meats (chicken and seafood).\nA SALAD TO BE EATEN WITH COLD MEAT OR FOWL.\nThe yolk of a raw egg, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, (it is better if mixed the day before,) half a tea-spoonful of salt. The mustard and salt to be rubbed together; then add the egg. Pour on very slowly the sweet oil, rubbing hard all the time, till as much is made as is wanted. Then add a table-spoonful of vinegar. When these ingredients are mixed, they should look perfectly smooth. If it curdles, add a little more mustard, or a little vinegar. With shrimps or oysters, a little red pepper rubbed in, is an improvement.\nAbby Fisher similarly describes making a homemade mayonnaise, before adding it to chicken and white celery.One of the first American forms of chicken salad was served by Town Meats in Wakefield, Rhode Island, in 1863. The original owner, Liam Gray, mixed his leftover chicken with mayonnaise, tarragon, and grapes. This became such a popular item that the meat market was converted to a delicatessen.\n\nChicken salad is among the Fourth of July foods listed by The American System of Cookery (1847).\n\nSee also\nChicken Salad Chick \u2212 a fast casual chain restaurant that specializes in chicken salad\nChicken sandwich\nList of chicken dishes\nList of sandwiches\nCoronation chicken\nChinese chicken salad\n Food portal\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Chicken salad is any salad with chicken as a main ingredient.

Optional seasonings include dry hot mustard, sesame seeds, coriander and raw ginger or pickled ginger. In restaurants, Chinese chicken salad may be more embellished and offered as an American-style entree salad, similar to Caesar, Chef, and Cobb salads.\n\nHistory\nThe Chinese chicken salad that is popular in the US seems to be a product of pan-Asian cuisine or fusion cuisine influences, rather than having roots in Chinese cuisine. Reasoning for that theory is that green lettuce salad is a dish of primarily Western origins.Many non-Western world cultures also have salads of various sorts as part of their traditional cuisines. In Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads, Sylvia Lovegren writes, \"There are many different types of cold chicken salad in China, although most of them seem to originate in Szechwan. But the Chinese chicken salad being consumed ... by the fashionable set, probably originated in California.\" In Hollywood Dish, Akasha Richmond writes, \"Hollywood gave rise to more salads than just the Caesar and Cobb. The 1960s produced the Chinese (or Shredded) Chicken Salad, which was popular at Madame Wu's in Santa Monica. Cary Grant told her about the dish.\" According to a website about Sylvia Wu, who is popularly known by her alias Madame Wu, \"She came up with something better, using a recipe she vaguely remembered having encountered in Shanghai. It was a blend of shredded chicken, fried vermicelli, green onions and toasted almonds. Madame Wu\u2019s soon became known for her Chinese chicken salad, now an American luncheon classic.\"In the United States, many common cookbooks from circa 1900 to the 1950s would include chicken salad; but, for many of them, that would often presume a bound salad with chopped vegetables and mayonnaise, typically without lettuce.  For example,  The Settlement Cookbook by Mrs. Simon Kander, published as early as 1910, includes a simple \"Lettuce salad\" with chopped onion and French or German dressing; but, no Chinese, Asian or Oriental salad of any kind.  Similar bound chicken salads are found in the 1974 edition of Joy of Cooking (first published 1931).  It was by 1950s that main course type salads started to appear in books like Better Homes & Gardens, New Cook Book; whereas, that often included Caesar salad along with the usual bound chicken salad, but no Asian-styled or -flavored salads.  The Good Housekeeping Cookbook introduced a \"Sesame-Spinach Salad,\" with soy sauce and salad oil, although not with sesame oil; whereas, this introduced something closer to Asian flavors, such as a few curry salads and others similar to those of Better Homes. The next generation of ever more exotic and main course salads were on the way.\nWith intimations of Asian-style lettuce salads appearing by the 1950s and into the 1970s, publishers like California's Sunset Magazine stated in their popular cookbooks and guides that \"You'll find such classics as Caesar, Waldorf, and Crab Louis; international favorites with exotic names like Tabbuli and Antipasto; satisfying whole-meal salads like Shrimp-stuffed Avocados and Taco Salad...\" and so on. Suddenly, sesame seeds went from just being a garnish on a salad, to being an ingredient for a recipe of \"Sesame Seed Dressing\" (p. 6); but, more over, and indeed, there was now a recipe for \"Chinese Chicken Salad\" (p. 35).\nSunset's recipe for Chinese Chicken appeared similarly as to what it's known as today, including: soy sauce; salad oil; garlic and ginger; (relatively exotic) Chinese five-spice or (more common substitute, ground cinnamon); broiler fryer chicken (marinated in sherry wine); sesame seed; shredded iceberg lettuce; green onions; coriander (cilantro); cashews or peanuts; and lemon dressing.  It was noted therein, that \"Many variations of this salad vie for popularity.  This one, without traditional crisp noodles, is simpler than most...\" since, fried vermicelli noodles is probably difficult to find and make for many homemakers. Most of these recipes had not yet included sesame oil, seemingly still rare to find for most homemakers.\nBeyond that, perhaps reflecting the California lifestyle and its eventual approach to the newer California Cuisine that used fresh ingredients and contemporary, multicultural flare, Sunset also now provided countless other Asian salad recipes, seeming to recognize the new trend and desire: Oriental Cabbage Slaw (p. 24); Oriental Wilted Romaine Salad (p. 25); Chicken in Cantaloupe with Curry Dressing (no lettuce) (p. 33); Hoisin Chicken Salad (p. 36); Oriental Turkey Salad (p. 37); and so on. The new Chinese and other Asian salads were added with a broad arrangement of other main salads, although perhaps not authentic, they were nevertheless styled and inspired by exotic cuisines and ingredients. Sunset's salad book and recipes seemed to appeal to Americans's desire for greater variety and international fares.\nThe continued popularity of Chinese chicken salad has established its regular feature on many restaurant menus, including from the fast food establishment Wendy's \"Asian Cashew Chicken Salad\" to the upscale \"Chinois Chicken Salad\" by Wolfgang Puck; of which, this later figure is indeed one of the few pioneers of California Cuisine.\nToday's Chinese chicken salad has been developed, but found its contributions from various restaurants, cookbooks and online recipes. As a quick and easy homestyle salad this salad may contain a combination of water chestnuts and mandarin orange slices; as well as use of store-bought instant ramen noodles and a seasoning packet that is used to flavor a vinaigrette dressing. All of these recipes provide variations of the salad's style and theme; all of them representing interpretations from various contributors.\nWhile Chinese chicken salad, and its variations, have also been known as \"Asian Chicken Salad\" and \"Oriental Chicken Salad\"; more over, it has as well (sometimes) seen the removal of chicken from the dish and its name (if not adding or substituting other ingredients, like seafood).\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Chinese chicken salad is a salad including chopped chicken and Chinese culinary ingredients that is common in parts of the United States.

Croutons are used to add texture and flavor to salads\u2014notably the Caesar salad\u2014 as an accompaniment to soups and stews, or eaten as a snack food.\n\nEtymology\nThe word crouton is derived from the French cro\u00fbton, itself a diminutive of cro\u00fbte, meaning \"crust\". Croutons are often seen in the shape of small cubes, but they can be of any size and shape, up to a very large slice. Many people now use crouton for croute, so the usage has changed. Historically, however, a croute was a slice of a baguette lightly brushed with oil or clarified butter and baked. In English descriptions of French cooking, cro\u00fbte is not only a noun but also has a verb form that describes the cooking process that transforms the bread into the crust.\n\nPreparation\nThe preparation of croutons is relatively simple. Typically the cubes of bread are lightly coated in oil or butter (which may be seasoned or flavored for variety) and then baked. Croutons can also be cut into sticks.  Some commercial preparations use machinery to sprinkle various seasonings on them. Alternatively, they may be fried lightly in butter or vegetable oil, until crisp and brown, to give them a buttery flavor and crunchy texture. Some croutons are prepared with the addition of cheese.Nearly any type of bread\u2014in a loaf or pre-sliced, with or without crust\u2014may be used to make croutons. Dry or stale bread or leftover bread is usually used instead of fresh bread. Once prepared, the croutons will remain fresh far longer than unprepared bread.\n\nList of possible ingredients\nbread\ngarlic\nbutter or oil (e.g., olive oil or rapeseed oil)\nParmesan\nherbs\nspices (ground or whole)\n\nGastronomy\nA dish prepared \u00e0 la Grenobloise (in the Grenoble manner) has a garnish of small croutons along with beurre noisette, capers, parsley, and lemon.\nDried and cubed bread is commonly sold in large bags in North America to make Thanksgiving holiday stuffing or dressing.

Frequently the eggplant is baked or broiled over an open flame before peeling, so that the pulp is soft and has a smoky taste. Baba ghanoush is usually eaten as a dip with pita bread, and is sometimes added to other dishes. It is usually of an earthy light brown color. In Ethiopia, this dish is commonly known as blagadoush.\n\nSimilar to baba ghanoush is another Levantine dish mutabbal (\u0645\u062a\u0628\u0644 lit. 'spiced'), which also includes mashed cooked aubergines and tahini, and mixed with salt, pepper, olive oil, and anar seeds.

The eggplants are grilled on an open flame until they are covered with black ash crust. The crust is cleaned off and the remaining cooked eggplant is mashed with a blunt, thick wooden cleaver (knife) on a wooden platter (popular belief has it that using a metal knife will turn the eggplant flesh black, before stainless steel blades, but also because cutting through the seeds is to be avoided). The eggplant mash is mixed in a bowl, stirring continuously, with sunflower oil, chopped onions and salt. The mix is beaten vigorously. Crushed garlic and ground pepper may be added too. Instead of oil, mayonnaise can be used, although not traditionally.  A zest of lemon is added at the end and the platter is sometimes garnished with tomato slices.\nA typical zakuska in Russia and Ukraine is known as bakla\u017eannaja ikra (Russian: \u0431\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043a\u0440\u0430, \"aubergine caviar\").

It is made with grilled mashed eggplant, olive oil, lemon juice and garlic; sometimes, tahini, chopped tomato and green pepper as well. More frequently, eggplant is mixed with yoghurt, olive oil and garlic. The version with cut eggplants can be found in southern Turkey, especially in Antakya. In other varieties, called \u015fak\u015fuka or k\u00f6po\u011flu, roasted and chopped eggplants and peppers are served with garlic yogurt or tomato sauce. The latter is also a typical eggplant appetizer in Bulgaria, where it is called kyopolou.

Gado-gado in Indonesian literally means \"mix-mix\" since it is made of a rich mixture of vegetables such as potatoes, longbeans, bean sprouts, spinach, chayote, bitter gourd, corn and cabbage, with tofu, tempeh and hard-boiled eggs, all mixed in peanut sauce dressing, sometimes also topped with krupuk and sprinkles of fried shallots. Gado-gado is different from Lotek atah or karedok which uses raw vegetables. Another similar dish is the Javanese pecel.\n\nRegion\nGado-gado is widely sold in almost every part of Indonesia, with each area having its own modifications. It is thought to have originally been a Sundanese dish, as it is most prevalent in Western parts of Java (which includes Jakarta, Banten, and West Java provinces). The Javanese have their own slightly similar version of a vegetables-in-peanut-sauce dish called pecel which is more prevalent in Central and East Java. Gado-gado is widely available from hawkers' carts, stalls (warung) and restaurants and hotels in Indonesia; it is also served in Indonesian-style restaurants worldwide. Though it is customarily called a salad, the peanut sauce is a larger component of gado-gado than is usual for the dressings in Western-style salads; the vegetables should be well coated with it.\nSome eating establishments use different mixtures of peanut sauce, such as adding cashew nuts for taste. In Jakarta, some eating establishments boast gado-gado as their signature dish, some of which have been in business for decades and have developed faithful clientele. For example, Gado-Gado Boplo restaurant chain has been around since 1970, while Gado-Gado Bonbin in Cikini has been around since 1960.The sauce is made of fried crushed savory peanuts, sweet palm sugar, garlic, chilies, salt, tamarind and a squeeze of lime. Gado-gado is generally freshly made, sometimes in front of the customers to suit their preferred degree of spiciness, which corresponds to the amount of chili pepper included. However, particularly in the West, gado-gado sauce is often prepared ahead of time and in bulk. Gado-gado sauce is also available in dried form, which simply needs to be rehydrated by adding hot water.\nGado-gado sauce is not to be confused with satay sauce, which is also a peanut sauce.\n\nHistory\nThe history of this Indonesian culinary dish does not have a fixed historical background. Rather, there are several different theories and beliefs as to how gado-gado became an Indonesian culinary dish. The different theories and beliefs are written below:\n\nIndonesian word \"digado\"\nGado-gado comes from the Indonesian word \u201cdigado\u201d. However, the word \u201cdigado\u201d does not exist in the Indonesian dictionary. The word \u201cdigado\u201d originates from a specific Indonesian culture, Betawi. In the Betawi language, the word means \u201cto not be eaten with rice\u201d, which is why rice is not included as one of the key ingredients of gado-gado. Rather, a substitute of rice is used, which is known as lontong, otherwise known as Indonesian rice cake.\n\nTugu Village\nAnother theory is that gado-gado originated from the Tugu village. In the early 1700s, when the Europeans arrived in Indonesia, a number of Portuguese people started a village currently known as the Tugu village. It is said that these Portuguese people brought their local cuisine to Indonesia. Through the introduction of the Portuguese culture, the dish gado-gado was first introduced to Indonesia.\n\nChinese Origin\nThere are also some who claim that gado-gado originated from the Chinese people living in Betawi. Some claim that the Chinese people really enjoyed the Javanese pecel, which is an Indonesian salad, and wanted to modify the dish to better accommodate their taste. As a result, the dish gado-gado was created.\n\nVariations\nGado-gado Betawi\nThis variation of gado-gado originates from Betawi in Jakarta and is known for being prepared differently as compared to the other variations.\n\nGado-gado Padang\nUnlike gado-gado sederhana, gado-gado Padang adds yellow noodles and sohun, which are cellophane noodles, to the gado-gado dish. This variation of gado-gado originated from Padang in West Sumatra. It is also known to have a spicy flavor. This variation follows other common dishes in Padang, which are known for having a spicy flavor.\n\nGado-gado Sederhana\nA translation of \u201cgado-gado sederhana\u201d is \u201csimple gado-gado\u201d. This variation is the basic way of preparing a gado-gado dish, which is made using vegetables, bean sprouts, lontong and peanut sauce as key ingredients.\n\nGado-gado Sidoarjo\nThis variation of gado-gado originated from Sidoarjo and is created using an addition of petis, which is a food additive added to the peanut sauce.\n\nGado-gado Surabaya\nThis variation of gado-gado cooks the peanut sauce and spreads it over the dish. Some claim that cooking the peanut sauce makes the dish last longer. It uses lettuce and tomatoes as some of the ingredients of the dish. It also uses coconut milk in the peanut sauce, which is used to make the sauce look oilier and more tasteful.\n\nIngredients\nPeanut dressing\nMost of flavours in gado-gado are acquired from the mixture of its bumbu kacang or peanut salad dressing. Gado-gado combines  slightly sweet, spicy and savory tastes. The common primary ingredients of the peanut sauce are as follows:\n\nground fried peanuts (kidney beans may be substituted for a richer taste)\ncoconut sugar/palm sugar (substitute brown sugar if unavailable)\nchillies (according to preference and desired degree of spiciness)\nterasi (dried shrimp paste)\nsalt\ntamarind juice\nlime juice\nwater to diluteThe traditional method of making gado-gado is to use the cobek (pestle) and ulekan or flat rounded stone. The dry ingredients are ground first, then the tamarind liquids are added to achieve the desired consistency.\n\nVegetables\nThe composition of the vegetable salad varies greatly, but usually comprises a mixture of some of the following:\n\nblanched - shredded, chopped, or sliced green vegetables such as cabbage, kangkung, spinach, bean sprouts, boiled young jack fruit, chayote, string bean, green bean, bitter melon, and corn.\nsliced - boiled potatoes\nuncooked - sliced cucumber, tomato, and lettuce.\npeeled and sliced boiled eggs\nsliced - fried tofu and tempehOutside Indonesia, it is usual to improvise with whatever vegetables are available.\nAll the ingredients are blanched or lightly boiled, including vegetables, potatoes and bean sprouts, except for the tempeh and tofu, which are fried, and cucumber which is sliced and served fresh. The blanched vegetables and other ingredients are mixed well with the dressing.\n\nGarnishes and rice\nIn Indonesia gado-gado is commonly served mixed with chopped lontong or ketupat (glutinous rice cake), or with steamed rice served separately.  It is nearly always served with krupuk, e.g. tapioca crackers or emping, Indonesian style fried crackers, which are made from melinjo. A common garnish is bawang goreng, a sprinkle of finely-chopped fried shallot.\n\nServing\nThere are three common ways of serving the gado-gado dish in Indonesia. Firstly, gado-gado is sometimes prepared at home as a traditional Indonesian dish. It is relatively easy to prepare and cook, which is part of the reason why gado-gado can be commonly found in Indonesian households. Secondly, some street vendors and warungs in Indonesia are known to sell gado-gado. However, different cities may serve different variations of gado-gado depending on the region. Thirdly, gado-gado can also be found in restaurants that serve Indonesian cuisine. Amongst many Indonesian restaurants, gado-gado is a relatively common dish, because it is popular in Indonesia.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nGado gado recipe\nGado gado Surabaya recipe\nGado gado recipe\nRecipe for Gado Gado with Beef (including pics)", "summary": "Gado-gado (Indonesian or Betawi) is an Indonesian salad of raw, slightly boiled, blanched or steamed vegetables and hard-boiled eggs, boiled potato, fried tofu and tempeh, and lontong (rice wrapped in a banana leaf), served with a peanut sauce dressing.In 2018, gado-gado was promoted as one of five national dishes of Indonesia; the others are soto, sate, nasi goreng, and rendang.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Flag_of_Indonesia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Gado-Gado_stall.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Gado_gado_jakarta.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Gado_gado_ulek.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Nasi_Kuning_dan_Ungkep_Ayam.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"]}, {"pageid": 41787358, "title": "Glasswort salad", "text": "Glasswort salad or samphire salad (Turkish: Deniz b\u00f6r\u00fclcesi salatas\u0131) is a salad in Turkish cuisine.

Common additions include green bell pepper slices or caper berries (especially on the Dodecanese islands). Greek salad is often imagined as a farmer's breakfast or lunch, as its ingredients resemble those that a Greek farmer might have on hand.\n\nOutside Greece\nOutside Greece, \"Greek salad\" may be a lettuce salad with Greek-inspired ingredients, even though the original dish is distinguished by the absence of lettuce. Meanwhile, the variant without lettuce may be called horiatiki, 'peasant salad', or 'village salad'.\nHowever in most European countries, including the UK, the dish broadly resembles the original, albeit often with non-Greek substitutions such as another cheese since feta cheese enjoys protected designation of origin status.\nIn an American-style Greek salad, lettuce, tomatoes, feta (often served in multiple cube-shaped cuttings mixed with the vegetables), and olives are the most standard elements, but cucumbers, peperoncini (pickled hot peppers), bell peppers, onions, radishes, dolmades, and anchovies/sardines are common. Regional variants may include unusual components, e.g. in Detroit, beets, and in the Tampa Bay Area, potato salad. Dressings containing various herbs and seasonings are frequently used in the U.S. These styles of Greek salad are rarely encountered in Greece.\nVarious other salads have also been called \"Greek\" in the English language in the last century, including some with no apparent connection to Greek cuisine. A 1925 Australian newspaper described a Greek salad of boiled squash dressed with sour milk; a 1934 American newspaper described a mayonnaise-dressed lettuce salad with shredded cabbage and carrots.\n\nOther salads in Greece and Cyprus\nThere are many other salads in Greek cuisine.

The salad is dressed with either fresh lemon juice or olive oil, or both. Za'atar and yogurt are very common dressings at breakfast while sumac and tahini are common the rest of the day. Generally, the cucumbers are not peeled. The ability to chop the tomatoes and cucumbers into the \"finest, most perfect dice\" is considered a mark of status among many kibbutz cooks. Traditional recipes do not include lettuce.In Israeli restaurants and cafes, Israeli salad is served as an independent side dish, as an accompaniment to main dishes, or stuffed in a pita with falafel or shawarma. It was a major part of the traditional Israeli breakfast at home before Western-style breakfast cereals became popular, and today it remains a standard feature at buffet breakfasts at Israeli hotels, as well as in many homes.\n\nHistory\nAlthough cucumbers have an ancient history in the Middle East, tomatoes, native to South America, were not cultivated in the Syria region until possibly as late as the 19th century, during the Ottoman Empire. In the 1940, Kibbutz Beit Alfa pioneered a variety of cucumber named after the Kibbutz, which became the standard Israeli cucumber used in this salad.Food historian Gil Marks describes how Jewish immigrants in the late 19th century first encountered the cucumber and tomato salad in then-Ottoman Palestine, and traces its presence there back to the Turkish \u00e7oban salatas\u0131 (shepherd's salad). Since the cucumbers and tomatoes were familiar vegetables to both European and Middle Eastern immigrants, they were quickly incorporated into their common diet. The Kibbutz breakfast incorporated a variety of salad and fresh vegetables. Adopted and popularized by the kibbutzim across the land, this salad latter migrated to all areas of the Israeli cuisine.\nVariations on the basic recipe have been made by the different Jewish communities that immigrated to the country. For example, Jews from India prepare it with the addition of finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.\n\nSimilar salads\nIsraeli Arabs or Palestinians may call their traditional cucumber and tomato salad salatat al-bandura or salatat banadura (\"tomato salad\"), or salata na'meh.\nOther similar salads found in the Middle East, include the Persian salad shirazi \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0634\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0632\u064a (which includes mint, diced onions, and peeled cucumbers), and the Turkish \u00e7oban salatas\u0131; among others found throughout the eastern Mediterranean area in Turkey, Lebanon, and Egypt. The Indian subcontinent cuisine also includes a variant of this salad, called \"kachumber\".\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Israeli salad (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05b8\u05dc\u05b8\u05d8 \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05e7\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9, romanized: salat yerakot yisra'eli, literal translation \"Israeli vegetable salad\") is a chopped salad of finely diced tomato, onion, cucumber, and bell or chili peppers.

It is also referred to as Philippine ceviche due to its similarity to the Latin American dish ceviche. It is more accurately a cooking process that relies on vinegar and acidic fruit juices (usually citrus) to denature the ingredients, rather than a dish, as it can also be used to prepare meat and vegetables. Kinilaw dishes are usually eaten as appetizers before a meal, or as finger food (Tagalog: pulutan) with alcoholic drinks. Kinilaw is also sometimes called kilawin, but it should not be confused with the northern Philippine grilled meat dish, kilawin, to which it is related to but is different.\n\nDescription\nThe most common kinilaw dish is kinilaw na isda (\"fish kinilaw\")  prepared using raw cubed fish mixed with vinegar (usually coconut vinegar or cane vinegar) as the primary denaturing agent; along with a souring agent to enhance the tartness like calamansi, dayap, biasong, kamias, tamarind, green mangoes, balimbing, and green sineguelas. It is flavored with salt and spices like black pepper, ginger, onions, and chili peppers (commonly siling labuyo or bird's eye chili). An average serving of fish kinilaw contains just 147 calories.To neutralize the fishy taste and acidity before serving, juice extracts from the grated flesh of tabon-tabon, dungon, or young coconuts are also commonly added. Extracts from the bark scrapings of sineguelas or bakawan trees (Rhizophora mangroves) are also used similarly. Some regional variants also include gat\u00e2 (coconut milk), sugar, or even soft drinks to reduce the sourness.Fish are primarily used, ranging from tanigue or tangigue (Spanish mackerels, king mackerel, or wahoo), malasugi (marlins or swordfish), tambakol, bangus, shark, and anchovies. Other viands include shrimp, squid, clams, oysters, crabs, sea urchin roe, seaweed, jellyfish, shipworms (tamilok) or even beetle larvae.\nSeafood must be fresh and properly cleaned, mitigating health hazards involved with consuming raw seafood. Some like squid, however, must be blanched to tenderize the flesh.\n\nEnsalada\nKinilaw also refers to dishes using raw fruits and vegetables marinated in vinegar and spices, in which case the dishes are sometimes referred to by the Spanish term ensalada (\"salad\"). Examples include pipino, ampalaya, young camote leaves, young papaya, pako, and banana flowers.\n\nHistory\nKinilaw is native to the Philippines. The Balangay archaeological excavation site in Butuan (dated c. 10th to 13th century AD) has uncovered remains of halved tabon-tabon fruits and fish bones cut in a manner suggesting that they were cubed, thus indicating that the cooking process is at least a thousand years old. It was also described by Spanish colonists and explorers to the Philippines, with the earliest mention being in the Vocabulario de la lengua tagala (1613) as cqinicqilao and cquilao, a Hispanicized spelling of the Visayan verb kilaw (\"to eat raw\"), and a cognate of the adjective hilaw (\"raw\", \"uncooked\", or \"unripe\").  Other sources that mention it include the Vocabulario de la lengua Pampanga en romance (1732) as quilao; and in the 1754 edition of Vocabulario de la lengua tagala as quilauin.Unlike Latin American ceviches, which exclusively use citrus juices (which are not native to the Americas), kinilaw instead primarily uses a combination of vinegar and citrus (native to tropical Asia), and other acidic fruit juices.\n\nRegional names and variants\nSome of the oldest surviving kinilaw variants are from the southern Visayas and Northern Mindanao, like Cagayan de Oro's kinilaw (sometimes stylized as kinilaw de Oro) and Dumaguete's binakhaw. Both are direct descendants of ancient Visayan preparation methods as displayed in the Butuan archeological finds. These are the original versions that use tabon-tabon and dungon fruits respectively.Several regions of the Philippines have local specialties or names of kinilaw dishes. In the northern Philippines, the Ivatan people of the Batanes islands refer to kinilaw as lataven. Ivatan fish kinilaw is known as lataven a among (also spelled lataven a amung). In the southern Philippines, the Tausug people of the Sulu islands refer to fish kinilaw as lawal. Unlike other kinilaw dishes, lawal usesvinegar to wash the fish, and uses citrus fruits and other souring agents to denature the fish meat. Among the Sama-Bajau people, it is known as kilau or kinilau and sometimes includes unripe mangoes as a souring agent. Among the Maranao people of southwestern Mindanao, biyaring is a type of kinilaw made with tiny shrimp. It is a regional favorite and is notable because it is ideally prepared while the shrimp are still alive.A common way of serving kinilaw in the islands of Visayas and Mindanao is sinuglaw, which combines fish kinilaw (usually tuna) and charcoal-grilled pork belly (sinugba).\n\nSee also\nKilawin - related dish from northern Luzon that uses blanched and grilled meatKelaguen - Chamorro dish derived from kilawinHinava - related Malaysian dish in Sabah\nGohu ikan - related Indonesian dish in Maluku\n'Ota 'ika - related Polynesian dish\nPoke - related Hawaiian dish\nCeviche - similar Latin American dish\nList of other raw fish dishes\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Kinilaw (pronounced [k\u026an\u026a\u02c8la\u028a] or [k\u026a\u02c8n\u026ala\u028a], literally \"eaten raw\") is a raw seafood dish and preparation method native to the Philippines.

Grated coconut is then placed in a container with live coals (usually from burning coconut husks) until the grated coconut is toasted brown and emits a slightly burned odor. In modern versions, they can also be toasted briefly in an oven. The toasted grated coconut is then separated from the coals and moistened with vinegar. It is allowed to cool down and then squeezed to extract coconut milk that now has a smoky flavor. The coconut milk is then heated slowly with vinegar (usually coconut or cane vinegar), red onions, salt, and black pepper. Other spices can also be added to taste, including garlic, ginger, shallots, fish sauce, and chili peppers. The coconut milk must be heated slowly and prevented from boiling to avoid curdling. The banana blossoms are then added last and cooked until tender.A more modern variant uses eggplant (introduced during the Spanish colonial period) that is first grilled until soft and then peeled and mashed.\n\nVariations\nKulawong puso ng saging is also sometimes known as minanok (literally \"done like chicken\"), due to its texture being similar to shredded chicken.

It is usually served as vegetable side dish next to the main course, such as ayam goreng (fried chicken), ayam bakar (grilled chicken), pepes, pecel lele (fried catfish), fried gourami, and many other ikan goreng (fried fish) or ikan bakar (grilled fish).\n\nHistory\nThe history of lalab vegetables is obscure, due to lack of historical records. In the 15th century Old Sundanese manuscript Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian it was mentioned the common flavour of food in that times are, lawana (salty), kaduka (hot and spicy), tritka (bitter), amba (sour), kasaya (succulent), and madura (sweet). These tastes are native flavour which mostly acquired from plant and vegetables.\n\nIngredients\nOriginally, it was made from any available edible young leaves and raw vegetables known by Sundanese since ancient times. Today, though, most lalab consists of sliced cabbage, cucumbers, lettuce, green beans, yardlong beans, tomatoes, leunca, lemon basil, spinach, water spinach, pohpohan leaves (Pilea melastomoides), kenikir leaves (cosmos), cassava leaves, papaya leaves, chayote, and small, green eggplant. Sometimes, other exotic vegetables also are used, such as green, stinky petai and jengkol bean.Although most lalab vegetables are only washed in cold water and served raw, some boiled, steamed and fried variations are also available; for example, petai green beans can be served either raw or fried, while labu siam (chayote), water spinach and cassava leaves are usually served boiled.\nWhile most of vegetables are served raw or simply boiled or blanched, the main flavouring agent is its dressing, the hot and spicy sambal terasi which is chili paste in terasi shrimp paste. Most of recipes revolved around specific recipe of sambals.\n\nNutrients\nIn Indonesian cuisine, lalab often served as garnishing or as vegetable accompaniment to the main meal of fish or chicken; such as ayam goreng (fried chicken) or pecel lele (fried catfish). Lalab is rich in vitamins, minerals and fiber. Daily consumption of fresh vegetables is good for reducing cholesterol levels and improving digestive health. Vegetables are also rich in antioxidants, which contribute to fighting free radicals, and have antiaging and anticancer properties.

Laab is of Lao origin, but is also eaten beyond its origins, most prominently the neighboring former Lan Xang territory, or modern days Laos and the northeastern and northern areas of Thailand, Isan and Lanna. Other local variants of laab also feature in the cuisines of the Tai peoples of Shan State, Burma, and Yunnan Province, China.\n\nHistory\n\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois Aymonier, who visited Laos in 1883, described laab as a favorite dish of Lao people - a mixture of chopped onions or scallions, lemongrass leaves, fermented fish and chili mixed with fresh and boiled fish. The dish was eaten with steam-cooked sticky rice. Another French visitor, doctor Estrade, who arrived in 1893, described larb as a Lao main dish made with boiled fish, chili and ground roasted sticky rice.Depending on the method of preparation, it may be known by different names, including nam tok, goi/saa, yum/sua, and can be made with beef, buffalo, chicken, duck, fish, pork, shrimp, game meat, mushroom or even algae. Laab can be served raw, which is known as laab diip (raw) or aharn suer (tiger food), or cooked, and usually served with a soup made with the bones of the meat being used.Historically, laab dishes were more common to aristocrats and traditional recipes for laab served to Laotian royalty are in a collection of handwritten recipes from Phia Sing (1898-1967), royal chef and master of ceremonies. Laab is considered to be an auspicious and lucky dish because traditionally meat was not readily available, and most Laotians would normally eat laab at special occasions, such as wedding, New Year celebrations and festivals. Many Laotians will bless their family and guests with a meal consisting of laab for luck and good fortune. During the New Year celebration, many Lao families believe that eating laab on day one of the three-day celebration will bring good fortune for the rest of the year.Prior to the collapse of the monarchy, in Laotian high society, servants were never allowed to prepare the best and most delicate dishes. The women of Laotian high society considered it an honorable task and great opportunity to display their culinary talents to prepare laab for their esteemed guests. Among ordinary Laotians, when preparing laab, housewives would prepare the ingredients in separate containers as a mise en place, leaving the final honor of mixing all the ingredients in a large bowl to the head of the household. As tradition goes, the head of the family would start with malaxating the mincemeat - softening and incorporating it with a cupful of stock from the soup, then adding the toasted ground rice, pepper powder, garlic, salt, padaek sauce and finally chopped aromatics before serving.Laab has a meaning in the Lan Na dialect (1292-1775), the neighboring kingdom of Lan Xang (1353-1707, present day Laos). The name derived from the full word of \"\u0e08\u0e34\u0e4a\u0e19\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a\", the word \"\u0e08\u0e34\u0e4a\u0e19\" translates to animal meat while \"\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a\" means to chop into smaller pieces or mince in Lanna script (closely linked to Tai Tham).\n\nTypes\nLao style\nIn Laos, depending on how the dish is prepared, it may be known by different names, including nam tok, goi/saa, yum/sua. Modern laab is most often made with chicken, beef, duck, fish, pork or mushrooms, flavored with fish sauce, lime juice, padaek, roasted ground rice and fresh herbs. The meat can be either raw or cooked; it is minced and mixed with chili, mint, roughly ground toasted rice (khao khoua) and, optionally, assorted vegetables according to personal preference. The dish is served at room temperature and usually with a serving of sticky rice and raw or fresh vegetables. Traditionally, beef laab will only contain offal, bile, and all of the other ingredients without lime juice. Fish and shrimp laab are also traditionally absent lime juice but incorporate minced galangal. Compared to other laab, fish and shrimp laab does required an extra step. The deboned fish filet, or shrimp is minced, then pounded in a mortar and pestle until it turns to a gluey paste.  Padaek juice is carefully add to the mixture, and stirred to a desired consistency, before finishing off with the finely chopped galangal and other aromatic herbs.\n\nNam tok: Nam tok (Lao: \u0e99\u0ec9\u0eb3\u0e95\u0ebb\u0e81, Thai: \u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e15\u0e01) is a Lao and Thai word meaning 'waterfall'. The name is derived either from the dripping of the meat juices during the grilling or from the juices running out of the medium rare beef as it is sliced. It refers to a popular Lao meat dish in both Laos and Isan, where it is commonly known as ping sin nam tok (Laos) or nuea yang nam tok (Thailand). This dish can be regarded as a variation on the standard laab, and is made from barbecued pork or beef, usually the neck, which is sliced in bite-size pieces. The meat is then brought to a boil with some stock to create sauce. The heat is turned off, and then sliced shallots, ground roasted rice, chili powder, lime juice, and fish sauce are added, along with shredded coriander leaves, spring onions and mint leaves.\nGoi/Saa: Goi (Lao: \u0e81\u0ec9\u0ead\u0e8d), Saa (Lao: \u0eaa\u0ec9\u0eb2) is a laab-like dish with the meat sliced thinly, rather than minced. In Luang Prabang and northern Laos this method of preparation is referred to as saa, whereas in Vientiane and southern Laos it is known as goi. Raw goi or saa made with the freshest and highest quality fish is served to the most honored guests because it is the most delicate and complicated dish to prepare. A properly made goi or saa requires great knife skills and talent. The raw fish is filleted, deboned and sliced. The fish is then left to soak in a marinade consisting of saltwater brine and lime juice for 2 up to a maximum of 15 minutes depending on preference. This denaturing of the proteins \u201ccooks\u201d the fish much like the Latin American dish ceviche. Once marinated, the meat is squeezed until dry to remove the excess liquid. The left-over marinade from the fish is then combined with padaek and brought to a boil before being left to cool to form a sauce. When everything is ready, the fish is mixed with the sauce, roasted rice powder, pepper flakes, and finely chopped aromatic herbs, such as fennel, galangal, lemongrass, Laotian parsley, shallot, green onions, and mint. The mixture can further be seasoned with more salt or lime to taste. The final dish is a pale pink fish salad with green aromatics and always served with the soup stock of the fish bone, fresh vegetables and sticky rice. A similar dish exists in Vietnam known as bo tai chanh.\nYum/Sua: Another style more ancient, which was popular amongst the aristocrats and served to Lao royalty is yum gai tom (boiled chicken) or sua gai (chicken). The recipes for the royal yum gai tom is found in Phia Sing\u2019s writing. Yum gai tom or sua gai is prepared by boiling a whole chicken with lemongrass, ginger, and kefir lime leaves. Once the chicken is cooked, the meat is removed from the carcass and chopped or shredded. Added to this are chopped cucumbers and tomatoes (optional), chili peppers, half-roasted shallots and garlic, and toasted rice powder. Broth is added to moisten, along with lime juice, and fish sauce. Pepper and salt are added to taste. It is finished with spring onions on top and coriander to garnish.\n\nTai Nyuan/Lan Na style\nLaab in the old kingdom of Lanna (1292-1775), is a local delicacy popular to aristocrats in the area. The name derived from the full word of \"\u0e08\u0e34\u0e4a\u0e19\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a\", the word \"\u0e08\u0e34\u0e4a\u0e19\" means animal meat while \"\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a\" means to chop into smaller pieces or mince in Lanna script (closely linked to Tai Tham).Laab was enjoyed in both raw or cooked forms depends on the likings. The cooked laab is mostly roasted and, therefore, called \u201c\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u201d (roasted laab).\nThe raw laab are known as \"\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e14\" (blood laab), popularly eaten alongside alcohol. In the ancient times, it is made solely by men and women were banned from the process due to the notion that women could contaminate the dish with menstruated blood.Lanna people often eat laab during auspicious celebrations such as the new year or Songkran, housewarming, weddings, ordination, and other Buddhist festivities. It is influenced by the Thai word \"\u0e25\u0e32\u0e20\" (derived from Pali) homophone: meaning unexpected luck or fortune.The laab from northern Thailand where the Lao have migrated, laab Lan Na, is different from the internationally more well-known Lao style laab. The northern Thai laab of the Tai Nyuan/Khon Muang (northern Thai people) does not contain fish sauce and is not sour, as neither lime juice nor any other souring agent is used. Instead, the northern Thai version uses a mix of dried spices as flavoring and seasoning which includes ingredients such as cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, prickly ash seeds and cinnamon amongst others, derived from the location of northern Thailand's Lan Na Kingdom on one of the spice routes to China, in addition to ground dried chillies, and, in the case of laab made with pork or chicken, the blood of the animal. The dish can be eaten raw (laab dip), but also after it has been stir-fried for a short time (laab suk). If blood is omitted from the preparation of the stir-fried version, the dish is called laab khua (Thai: \u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27). There is also a kind of laab called laab luat (Lao: \u0ea5\u0eb2\u0e9a\u0ec0\u0ea5\u0eb7\u0ead\u0e94) or lu (Thai: \u0e2b\u0e25\u0e39\u0e49). This dish is made with minced raw pork or beef, raw blood, kidney, fat and bile, and mixed with spices, crispy fried onions, fresh herbs and other ingredients. Laab and its other variations are served with an assortment of fresh vegetables and herbs, and eaten with glutinous rice. This version of laab is thought to have originated in the town of Phrae, in northern Thailand. This style of laab can also be found in parts of northern Laos.\n\nHealth risks of consuming raw\nThe risks from eating raw meat include contracting trichinosis, caused by an infectious worm, along with fatal bacterial or potentially rabies infection.\nThe consumption of raw laab and lu made with raw pork has led to several cases of human Streptococcus suis infections in Thailand, some of them with a deadly result.The consumption of raw freshwater fish can lead to an infection by Opisthorchis viverrini (Southeast Asian liver fluke), a parasitical flatworm that can live for many years inside the human liver.

Since then, McDonald's has become a household name in America, known for selling a variety of convenience food items at thousands of locations worldwide. Throughout its history, McDonald's has experimented with a number of different offerings on the menu. In 2007, McDonald's had only 85 items on its menu; by 2013 this number had risen to 145 items on its menu.\n\nHamburgers\nMcDonald's beef patties are seasoned with salt and ground pepper. This list is based on core menu items in the United States, with some additions from global and local products.\n\nHamburger\nHamburger (formerly known as the Junior Burger in some countries) consists of a 1.6-ounce (45 g) ground beef patty, with 0.125 ounces (3.5 g) ketchup, mustard, dill pickle slices and re-hydrated onions on a toasted bun. In most of the New York City area, it is served without mustard. It is also sold as a cheeseburger, double cheeseburger and triple cheeseburger, all of which have one, two or three slices of cheese respectively. A triple burger and a bacon double cheeseburger are optional items and are not available in all restaurants or markets. The hamburger and cheeseburger are the company's original grilled burger offerings, having been served as part of the 1948 menu.\n\nDouble Cheeseburger\nDouble Cheeseburger \u2013 two 1.6-ounce (45 g) ground beef patties, with 0.125 ounces (3.5 g) ketchup, mustard (except in all or much of the New York City area), two slices of dill pickle, rehydrated onions, and two pieces of cheese on a toasted bun. The double cheeseburger was offered as a promotional item in the 1950s and was added to the regular menu in 1965, though many McDonald's restaurants did not list it on their menu boards. An official variant is offered in the U.S. state of New Mexico, called the Green Chile Double Cheeseburger, topped with roasted green New Mexico chile peppers.\n\nTriple Cheeseburger\nTriple Cheeseburger \u2013 similar to the Double Cheeseburger, except it contains three burger patties, with a slice of American cheese between each patty, plus ketchup, mustard (except in parts of the New York City area), onion, and dill pickle.\n\nBig Mac\nThe Big Mac \u2013 a signature product that was introduced in 1967. The Big Mac consists of two 1.6-ounce (45 g) (approx. uncooked weight) ground beef patties, special Big Mac sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and diced onions in a sesame seed bun, with an additional middle bun (called a \"club layer\") separating the beef patties. The Grand Mac, its bigger-sized counterpart, was added in January 2017, and January 2019 saw the Bacon Big Mac debut. A smaller variant of the Big Mac, the Mac Jr., was also added in 2017. At least seven other variants have been offered.\n\nQuarter Pounder\nQuarter Pounder \u2013 a 4.25-ounce (120 g) (originally 4-ounce (113 g) until 2015) (approx. uncooked weight) ground beef patty with ketchup, mustard, chopped onions, pickle, and two slices of cheese. As with burgers made with the smaller 1.6-ounce (45 g) patties, the Quarter Pounder is prepared without mustard in all or a large portion of the New York City region. It was invented by Al Bernardin, a franchise owner and former McDonald's vice president of product development, at his McDonald's in Fremont, California, in 1971. In some markets unfamiliar with the United States customary units (such as France), it is known as a Royal Cheese, or variants thereof, such as McRoyale. It is also available as the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, which includes another patty of the same proportions. In 2013, McDonald's expanded the sandwich into a line with three additional variants to make them smaller versions of the Angus Burgers. It was renamed the Taste-Crafted Burger in 2016 in West Coast markets and later expanded to other U.S. markets in January 2017. The latest addition is the Signature Sriracha, reinstated in July through September and again since January 2018, which was replaced by Sweet Barbecue Bacon in May, before becoming Bacon Smokehouse from July 2018 to June 2019. It has since been replaced by Quarter Pounder with Cheese Bacon in July 2019. A Travis Scott Burger, aka Quarter Pounder BLT in Canada, was added in September 2020.\n\nBig N' Tasty\nBig N' Tasty, introduced in 1997 in California, was a 4-ounce (110 g) beef patty with ketchup, cheese, mayonnaise with grilled, diced onions, pickles, leaf lettuce, and tomatoes. It was devised to resemble Burger King's Whopper sandwich. It is also known as the Big Xtra in Slovenia and most of Canada; the McXtra in Quebec, Canada; the McFeast Deluxe in Australia; the Big Tasty (without the 'N') in Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy (without ketchup), Ireland, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Sweden and the United Kingdom; the Quarter Pounder Deluxe in South Africa; and the McNifica (a play on Spanish magnifica, 'wonderful') in Mexico and Latin America. The Big Tasty configuration is somewhat different, consisting of a third-pound (150 g) beef patty, sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, Emmental cheese, and Big Tasty sauce (which has a smoke flavor). The Big Tasty Bacon variant also contains strips of bacon. This variant was sold in the US until 2011; it is now sold internationally only. However, the Big N' Tasty is still sold at restaurants located in US army and naval bases, such as the McDonald's restaurant located at the US naval base in Yokusuka, Japan. It is now known as the Quarter Pounder with Cheese Deluxe since July 2019. It also comes with bacon on a Travis Scott Burger since September 2020.\n\nMcDouble\nMcDouble \u2013 similar to a Double Cheeseburger but with just one slice of cheese. Reintroduced as a permanent dollar-menu item in December 2008, it had been a short-term product in 1997, advertised with \"Eddie the Echo\". The original McDouble did not have cheese and was garnished with lettuce and tomatoes rather than with pickles and onions in the 2008 version.\n\nBacon McDouble\nBacon McDouble \u2013 a sandwich that is similar to the McDouble but has two pieces of applewood smoked bacon added to it. This sandwich was added to the U.S. \"Dollar Menu & More\" in November 2013.\n\nDaily Double\nDaily Double \u2013 similar to the McDouble; however, the toppings are slightly different. The Daily Double is prepared with lettuce, sliced tomato, slivered onions, and mayonnaise. It also has only one slice of cheese, like the McDouble, rather than the two slices that are on the double cheeseburger. In 2011 and 2012, the item was test marketed in various regional locations.\n\nMcFeast\nMcFeast \u2013 a hamburger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mayonnaise, in most markets from April 1977. The McFeast has been served since the mid-1980s in Sweden and was later introduced to the rest of the Nordic countries; the McFeast in Sweden contains a quarter pounder patty, lettuce, modified mayonnaise with lemon juice, onion and tomato. In the rest of the countries, the McFeast also contains ketchup, but not in Sweden. The same burger was sold under the name Mega Feast in New Zealand for several years during the 1990s but has since been discontinued. The McFeast Deluxe was sold in Australia until the late 1990s and contained: mustard, ketchup, large onions, McFeast Deluxe sauce, lettuce, a tomato slice, dill pickles, regular cheese and a quarter pounder patty served in a Quarter Pounder/McChicken Bun. It returned to the Australian menu in 2009 and in August 2011 using the same ingredients; however, it contained McChicken sauce in place of the original 'McFeast Deluxe' sauce. The McFeast has been sold in Germany and Austria since the 1990s under the name Hamburger Royal TS (T for Tomate 'tomato'; S for Salat, the German word for 'lettuce'). It contains a quarter-pounder patty, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese and the McChicken sauce. For special occasions, it is sold in Germany as a McFresh which also contains cucumber slices. It was renamed in the U.S. as the Quarter Pounder with Cheese Deluxe as of July 2019. Bacon is optional on a Travis Scott Burger in Canada and the U.S. since September 2020.\n\nOther notable burgers\n1955 Burger \u2013 this burger inspired by 1955 (according to the official site) contains beef, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, caramelized onions, ketchup and McDonald's smoky sauce (barbecue). Named after the year the fast-food chain was incorporated by Ray Kroc, the burger is popular in European markets, including Spain, Italy, and Germany. It was released in 2011 and re-released in 2013 in the UK.\nBBQ Ranch Burger \u2013 a very sweet hamburger containing one beef patty, cheddar cheese, BBQ Ranch sauce, and tortilla strips, added to the U.S. \"Dollar Menu and More\" in November 2013.\nMcSpicy Burger \u2013 a very spicy chicken breast, lettuce, cheese and hot sauce-laced mayo, served as the McSpicy Shake Shake Meal, complete with fries.\nBacon Clubhouse \u2013 a burger consisting of one quarter-pound patty, lettuce, tomato, and special sauce served on an artisan roll. This core item was added to the menu the week of March 12, 2014.\nJalape\u00f1o Double \u2013 similar to the McDouble, except it contains two types of jalape\u00f1o peppers, pickled and crispy, plus a slice of white cheddar cheese between the two burger patties, and buttermilk ranch sauce. Added to the Dollar Menu in April 2014.\nChiTown Classic \u2013 a regional offering that was one of two finalists out of hundreds of entries in the \"Chicagoland Burger Build Off\" competition to develop a breakfast-dinner mashup burger in 2015. The burger was placed on the menu in Chicago area locations starting mid-November until December 27, 2015. The burger adds breakfast's Canadian bacon and applewood smoked bacon.\nDenali Mac \u2013 a burger that looks like the Big Mac, but it uses two quarter-pound beef patties. Sold only in Alaska, named after Denali (formerly Mount McKinley).\n'M' burger - M Burger is made with 100 percent beef, has batavia lettuce, tomato and emmental cheese on a stone-baked ciabatta roll. Sold in France and the United Kingdom in 2008.\nAussie Angus Deluxe - The McDonald's Aussie Angus Deluxe is a hamburger that was offered by McDonald's in Australia. It consisted of a 100% Angus beef patty, bacon, beetroot, caramelized onions, lettuce, cheese, and a special sauce, served on a sesame seed bun. The burger was available for a limited time and was popular among McDonald's customers in Australia.\nCrispy McBacon - an Italy-exclusive burger with two beef patties, cheese, bacon, and a special sauce.\n\nChicken\nMcChicken\nA McChicken is a mildly spicy breaded and seasoned chicken sandwich which is also offered in a spicier variant (the Hot n' Spicy) in some markets. The sandwich is made from 100% ground white meat chicken, mayonnaise, and shredded lettuce, on a toasted bun. A full-size version was introduced in 1980, later removed, and reintroduced in 1988. In some markets, it is not spicy, and in others, a cajun spiced version is also offered. It remains one of the biggest sellers, just behind the Big Mac. The larger sandwich was replaced with the Crispy Chicken Deluxe in 1996, and brought back in 1998 in the current smaller size, and marketed as the Cajun (Style) McChicken. In Australia, the average serving size for a McChicken is 185 g (6.5 oz). In Canada, it remains a full-size sandwich, while the US' smaller version is sold there as the Junior Chicken.\n\nMcNuggets\nChicken McNuggets were introduced in 1983 as a replacement for the McChicken. They are small, breaded and seasoned chicken chunks served with dipping sauces of barbecue, sweet n' sour, honey, and hot mustard. McNuggets are available in four, six, ten (originally nine), or twenty pieces. In some regions, such as Australia, they are available in three, six, ten or twenty-four pieces. Occasionally, they are made available in 40- or 50-piece packs on a promotional basis. While made from a combination of white and dark meat until 2003, they are now made only with white meat. In 2011, five new dipping sauces were introduced and added to the line-up: sweet chili, honey mustard, spicy buffalo, and creamy ranch. With the addition of these new dipping sauces, McDonald's began phasing out the hot mustard sauce, and by February 2014, it had been discontinued in most U.S. markets, while in Quebec, Canada, at least, the original four dipping sauces (barbecue, sweet 'n sour, hot mustard and honey) persist as of 2018. As recently as of 2020, McDonald's has introduced \"spicy\" versions of this cult classic. Spicy McNuggets were added on 18 June 2015 in Singapore alongside curry sauce for dipping, to be eventually discontinued in 2021.\n\nPremium Chicken Sandwiches\nThe Premium chicken sandwich line was added in July 2005. The Classic was a rebranding of the Crispy Chicken and Chicken McGrill sandwiches, themselves 1998 rebrandings of the Deluxe chicken line. It contains mayonnaise, leaf lettuce, and a tomato slice. The Ranch BLT contains ranch sauce instead of mayonnaise and includes bacon. The Club is similar to the Classic, with added bacon and a piece of Swiss cheese. In Latin America, the Classic and the Club are sold, but a honey mustard chicken sandwich is sold in place of the BLT. All were served on a whole-grain roll, with either a grilled or crispy chicken breast. On March 20, 2014, the Premium Crispy Chicken Bacon Clubhouse and Premium Grilled Chicken Bacon Clubhouse were added to the line-up (alongside the beef variant of the sandwich) on a new artisan roll. In February 2015 the Ranch BLT and Club were removed from the menu. The standard crispy offering was renamed the Premium Crispy Chicken Deluxe (later the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich in August 2015) and it was upgraded to sit on the artisan roll introduced with the Bacon Clubhouse. In the first week of April 2015, McDonald's replaced the Premium Grilled Chicken sandwich with the Artisan Grilled Chicken.McDonald's line of larger chicken sandwiches (The Classic, Club, Ranch BLT, and Southwest), which are part of the McDonald's Premium line, were introduced in July 2005 as part of McDonald's menu revamp.\n\nThe Classic includes lettuce, tomato, and mayo.\nThe Club also has lettuce, tomato and mayo but also comes with Swiss cheese and bacon.\nThe Ranch BLT comes with a creamy ranch sauce, bacon, lettuce and tomato.\nThe Grand Chicken Burger: Large chicken patty with two layers of cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sauce.\nThe Southwest comes with a southwest style nacho chili sauce, lettuce, tomato, and spicy pepper jack cheese.All four can be chosen with either crispy or grilled chicken and all are served on a wheat ciabatta bun.\n\nPremium Chicken Deluxe\nPremium Chicken Deluxe \u2013 a sandwich made with a crispy chicken breast, tomato slices, and lettuce. It was first sold in 1996 and had its name changed to the Crispy Chicken Sandwich in 1998. It was replaced with a Premium chicken sandwich in July 2005 and was then brought back in 2015 under the original name with the added prefix Premium. The only other change is that it is now sold on an artisan roll instead of the potato bun that characterized the original Crispy Chicken Deluxe. By August 2015 it was renamed the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich. This is part of the Taste-Crafted Chicken sandwiches introduced in 2016.\n\nGrilled Chicken Deluxe\nGrilled Chicken Deluxe \u2013 this sandwich has the same ingredients as the Premium Crispy Chicken Deluxe but has a marinated, grilled chicken breast at its center. It has been sold under various names since 1996, when it was introduced as the Grilled Chicken Deluxe, and had its name changed to the Chicken McGrill in 1998. It was replaced with a Premium chicken sandwich in July 2005, which was in turn replaced with the Artisan Grilled Chicken in 2015. It is also available in India and has at times been available in Canada.\n\nTaste-Crafted\nTaste-Crafted Chicken sandwiches, like the Taste-Crafted Burgers, were introduced in 2016 in West Coast markets, and in all other U.S. markets in January 2017. Signature Sriracha was the latest to be added in June 2016, reinstated in July through September 2017, and reinstated again permanently in January 2018; it was replaced by Sweet Barbecue Bacon in May 2017, which by July 2018 was changed to Bacon Smokehouse.\n\nDeli Choices\nDeli Choices is a line of deli-style sandwiches that are sold internationally. It is targeted at health-conscious customers and is available in Austria, Canada, and Germany. It is similar to the McHero sandwich, sold in parts of the United States. In the UK, these were eventually replaced by the Big Flavour Wraps.\n\nSnack Wrap\nSnack Wrap \u2013 a wrap made with white meat chicken breast (crispy or grilled), lettuce, shredded Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese, and a sauce (spicy buffalo, ranch, honey mustard, chipotle barbecue, or salsa roja, the breakfast sauce on the McSkillet), wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. It was launched on July 1, 2006. Chipotle BBQ is the most recent flavor. The wrap is available in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Brazil. There is also a Mac Snack Wrap which features the fixings of the Big Mac but without the bun. It is wrapped in a tortilla shell, and uses one half of a piece of quarter meat.\n\nPremium Chicken McWrap\nIn 2013, McDonald's in the U.S. introduced a larger wrap that it has had success with in parts of Europe. It comes in three variants: Sweet Chilli Chicken, Chicken & Bacon, and Chicken & Ranch.\n\nChicken McBites\nSmall balls of chicken that are made from chicken breasts and are about 1.5 cm (0.59 in) in diameter. These were available in the US with trials starting in September 2011 and were discontinued in 2013.They remain available in some international markets, including Italy and Australia.\n\nMcArabia\nMcArabia \u2013 there are two versions of the McArabia: grilled chicken, and grilled kofta (spiced ground beef). Both are served with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and garlic mayonnaise in addition to two small patties of grilled chicken or kofta, all wrapped in an Arabian-style pita bread. McDonald's has employed a rather large advertising campaign for the McArabia since its introduction in 2003, largely focusing on the Arabian-themed nature of the sandwich, and it appears to have worked well. The McArabia has been very well received throughout Southwestern Eurasia. The same product is also introduced in Malaysia with \"Chicken Foldover\" as an alternative name.\n\nButtermilk Crispy Tenders\nButtermilk Crispy Tenders were strips formulated with the buttermilk recipe used for the August 2015 revamp of the fried chicken sandwich, and were introduced in U.S. restaurants in September 2017. While they bear a resemblance to Chicken Selects, they are created and prepared differently. They feature a buttermilk chicken base and are cooked from thawed instead of frozen. This creates a juicier product than the Selects, as well as reduces cook time, though immediate supply issues caused them to effectively be removed from the menu until the end of December 2017. This was caused by demand being much higher than forecast. They were discontinued in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOther notable chicken products\nChicken Fajita \u2013 chicken, cheese, red and green bell peppers, and diced onions in a flour tortilla. Comes with picante sauce packets on request, which are available in mild and spicy. Available in only a few markets.\nArtisan Grilled Chicken \u2013 in the first week of April 2015, McDonald's introduced a redesigned grilled chicken patty, replacing the Premium Grilled Chicken sandwich, which contains \"fewer ingredients\", and those that remain can be found in consumers' \"own kitchens\". The sandwich sits atop the artisan roll first seen with the Bacon Clubhouse and is the last of the full-size chicken sandwiches to switch to this bun. It is part of the Taste-Crafted Chicken sandwiches menu introduced in 2016. It was discontinued in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMaharaja Mac \u2013 in India, McDonald's does not serve beef in its burgers. Instead, it has created a large Big Mac-style chicken burger called the Chicken Maharaja Mac, with a chicken patty and vegetable garnishings.\nTasty Basket \u2013 available only in Italy, the Tasty Basket consists of 30 pieces of chicken, which includes the Chicken McNugget, Chicken McBites, and chicken wings.\nChicken Selects \u2013 still available in the U.K., these are strips of chicken cooked from frozen and served in a three- or five-piece serving.  They were discontinued in the United States and eventually replaced with Buttermilk Crispy Tenders.\nSouthern Style Chicken Sandwich \u2013 a southern-style fried chicken breast filet is served on a steamed bun, dressed with butter and two pickles. Nearly identical to a Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. Discontinued at many franchises in early 2015.\nChicken Parmi Burger \u2013 a burger that was introduced onto the McDonalds Australia menu in 2021. The burger name comes from the word parmi, which is Australian slang for chicken parmigiana. This hamburger is made up of chicken breast topped with classic parmigiana sauce, bacon, and Australian-style cheese, together with a creamy cheese sauce.\nMcCrispy \u2013 Introduced in 2022 to the United Kingdom, the McCrispy is a spicy chicken breast fillet with shredded lettuce and black pepper mayo served in a seeded bun.\nChicken Big Mac \u2013 Introduced in 2022 to the United Kingdom, and in 2023 to Canada. All the same ingredients as a Big Mac, but with a chicken patty instead of a beef patty.\n\nFish\nFilet-O-Fish \u2013 a fish fillet with tartar sauce and a half slice of cheese on a steamed bun. It was introduced in Cincinnati in 1962 when it was discovered that many Roman Catholics chose to eat at Frisch's Big Boy on Fridays and during Lent, as it offered a fish sandwich so customers could go without meat. This was replaced with the Fish Filet Deluxe in 1996 and brought back in 1998 albeit with a larger fish patty. During the Easter period in Hawaii and Guam, a Double Filet-O-Fish meal is offered with two pieces of fish on one bun. In Spain, a variant called \"McFish\" also exists which replaces the tartar sauce and cheese with ketchup.\nFish McBites \u2013 similar to the Chicken McBites, these are small pieces of flaky whitefish dipped in batter and fried until golden brown, and served with tartar sauce for dipping. They were taken off the menu at the end of March 2013.\n\nPork\nMcRib \u2013 a sandwich featuring a ground pork patty coated in barbecue sauce, slivered onions, and pickles. First seen in test-market stores near interstate highways around Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin in the late 1970s (along with early tests of personal-sized pizza), the McRib was more widely released in 1981 but pulled from the menu in 1985. It is released annually in the U.S. as a limited-time promotion in some locations. Since 2005, the McRib has reappeared in late October, staying on the menu for 10 weeks. The McRib was released in Canada as a promotional sandwich from March 18 through April 8, 2008, and again in summer 2011. The McRib is presently on some European menus (e.g., Germany, where it has been standard since or even before 1990).\nIn Vietnam, grilled pork is sold, but with rice; egg is optional.\n\nSauces\nSzechuan Sauce\nSzechuan Sauce, or Mulan Sauce, was a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets created to promote the 1998 Disney film Mulan. The sauce was sold for a limited time, starting on June 16, 1998. Szechuan Sauce returned to the cultural spotlight almost twenty years later after being referenced numerous times in \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", the Season 3 premiere of the Adult Swim animated comedy Rick and Morty. The sauce was announced to return to all McDonald's stores on February 26, 2018, due to popular demand from Rick and Morty fans.On March 31, 2022, it once again returned to stores, featured as an app-only exclusive.\n\nOther products\nSalads\nMcDonald's introduced salads to its menu in 1987. Since that time, they have restructured their salad lines several times. McSalad Shakers, a green salad sold in a plastic cup designed to fit in vehicle cupholders, were introduced in 2000 and discontinued in 2003. McDonald's then launched a line of Premium Salads (as part of the McDonald's Premium line) and later introduced the Bacon Ranch Salad with Crispy Chicken and the Southwest Salad with Artisan Grilled Chicken. All of its salads are part of McDonald's move towards creating a healthier image.\nMcDonald's discontinued salads during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to improve order accuracy and service times. In 2022, franchises were given the option to add the Caesar Salad with Chicken and the Bacon and Southwest Style Salad to their menus; however, many franchises declined to offer the new items.\n\nSides\nFries\nMcDonald's advertises their french fries as their World Famous Fries. McDonald's US fries are made using 19 ingredients which include dextrose, TBHQ, polydimethylsiloxane, citric acid, and sodium acid pyrophosphate. As for their potatoes, non-GMO russet and Shepody kinds are used. Fries were first added to the menu in 1949, replacing potato chips. As for the manufacturing process, the potatoes are first brought to the plant where they are mechanically cut, blanched, partially fried, flash-frozen, then shipped to individual restaurants of the franchise and served.\n\nMcDonald's fries in the US were originally prepared using a frying oil mixture of 93% beef tallow and 7% vegetable oil known as Formula 47. The use of this oil blend allowed McDonald's to develop their fries' distinctive flavor and crispiness. In 1990, McDonald's was pressured into switching to frying oil that was entirely vegetable oil due to the National Heart Savers Association's campaign against saturated fats. The new US oil used a natural beef flavor additive; other countries' fries do not include any animal products. Then in 2007, the restaurant franchise switched again to a vegetable oil with less trans fats as concerns over the health risks of trans fats grew.\n\nLoaded Fries\nIn Australia McDonald's has sold multiple varieties of 'loaded fries' which consist of a portion of fries with a topping; these toppings include:\n\nGravy (currently offered) \nSweet Chili and Sour Cream\nGuacamole and Salsa\nParmesan cheese and truffle mayo\nBBQ & Aioli Sauce with Grilled Onions\n\nOther\nIn some international locations, they sell potato wedges, a type of potato chip that is thick cut and wedge-shaped and fried onion pieces that are similar to onion rings.\nMany McDonald's locations in discount stores offer freshly popped popcorn and soft pretzels in addition to the normal menu. In Pennsylvania stores, only soft pretzels are offered as a side option.\nGarlic fries were tested in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016, using locally grown garlic from Gilroy, California.\nBacon Cheese Fries was added to the menu in January 2019. It adds melted cheddar cheese to go with bacon pieces.\nIn Australia, all meals can have their side swapped from the default fries to Garden Salads for no extra charge.\n\nHappy Meal\nMcDonald's capitalized on Burger Chef's Funmeal concept of a children's meal when it introduced the first Happy Meal in 1979 (sometime later known as the Mighty Kids meal). The meal includes an entr\u00e9e, a side dish, a beverage and a toy. Happy Meals include a tiny order fries (around half of a small order of fries) and fruit, optional sauce for fries, and a choice of nuggets, a single patty burger, or wraps. An additional product, Pasta Zoo, was discontinued in 2008. The Mighty Kids Meal contains more food than the Happy Meal, less than the adult meal, and still contains a toy. The toy is usually a product tie-in with a movie or popular television show.\nIn mid-February 2012, McDonald's introduced the Happy Meals/Mighty Kids Meals so that they now come with either a hamburger, cheeseburger, four-piece Chicken McNuggets, McDouble or the 6-piece Chicken McNuggets with a smaller version of the small fry for the Happy Meal or a small fry for a Mighty Kids Meal. All kids meals now come with fries, apple slices, and a toy. The apple slices have been reduced from eight slices to only four and no longer come with caramel dipping sauce.\n\nIn the U.S., the main is a choice of hamburger, cheeseburger, or a four-piece order of Chicken McNuggets (or a double cheeseburger or six-piece order of Chicken McNuggets for the Mighty Kids Meals); the sides are fries and sliced apples. Milk, chocolate milk, boxed apple juice, and soda are choices for drinks. Some U.S. franchises also include a small cellophane package of McDonaldland cookies. In 2009, McDonald's offered a Happy Meal Wrap, but it was discontinued later that year due to low sales.\nIn the UK, the main is a choice of hamburger, cheeseburger, four Chicken McNuggets, three fish fingers, or a chicken wrap; the sides are a choice of fries, carrot sticks, cucumber sticks or a fruit bag (sliced apples and grapes (February \u2013 May, September \u2013 November), melon (June \u2013 August), or a pineapple stick (December \u2013 January)). Organic milk, Tropicana orange juice, apple and blackcurrant Robinsons Fruit Shoot, milkshakes, water and soda are the choices for drinks.\nIn New Zealand and Australia, the main is a choice of hamburger, cheeseburger, three or six-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, grilled chicken pieces, or a crispy or seared Chicken Snack Wrap; the sides are a choice of a small french fries, yogurt, grape tomatoes or apple slices.

In the 2010s, McDonald's had short-term reintroductions in Canada and Italy.\nMcCrab \u2013 in response to the McLobster, McDonald's along the eastern coast of the Delmarva Peninsula (comprising parts of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia) developed the McCrab sandwich, a McDonald's version of the Chesapeake crabcake.\nPoutine \u2013 originally only to be found in French-Canadian communities, poutine is now found on the menu at most McDonald's locations across Canada.\nAngus Snack Wrap \u2013 wrap with Angus burger introduced to the U.S. market on August 9, 2010.

Available at select stores in India, Greece, and Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.  Since McDonald's does not serve beef or pork in any of its products in India, it has created a few vegetarian options to suit the large vegetarian populace. Thus, the cheeseburger is recast as a vegetarian option and served as an \"Aloo Tikki Burger\" containing a potato patty and a slice of cheese.\nChicken McGrill\nGeorgie Pie \u2014 a meat pie sold in New Zealand. The brand was also the name of a New Zealand-based chain that was bought by McDonald's New Zealand in 1996 and was revived as part of the McDonald's menu in 2013 due to popular demand.\nVeggie Crunch Burger \u2013 The vegetarian burger was launched in the Singapore market on September 6, 2016. Its patty is made with a mixture of up to seven types of vegetables, including green peas, carrots, tomatoes, capsicum, beans, etc. However, its dressings contain garlic and eggs. The patty is fried in the same oil used for frying apple pies so it does not come in contact with meat products.In McDonald's UK, EotF (Experience of the Future) restaurants offer the premium Signature Collection, which consist of The Spicy, The Classic and The BBQ.

Among the cookies offered are sugar, oatmeal raisin, or chocolate chip.\nCinnamon Melts \u2013 a popular cinnamon roll type item with cream cheese icing.\nBrownie melts \u2013 similar to the Cinnamon Melt, only chocolate-flavored with fudge and cream cheese icing on top. Available only in selected markets.\nThe Fruit and Yogurt Parfait \u2013 a mix of frozen strawberries and blueberries and vanilla yogurt, sold with a package of granola topping.\nSmoothies are available in some locations in either blueberry pomegranate, strawberry banana, or mango-pineapple flavors. In the test market areas, smoothies were introduced in 2009.\nPineapple \u2013 In many Hawaii stores pineapple slices are served, in a McDonald's branded covered tray, with every meal. They can be left out of the meal, which reduces the meal price.\n\nDiscontinued food products\nBurgers\nAngus burgers \u2013 Four types: the Angus Deluxe (two slices of American cheese, sliced red onions and sliced red tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, pickles, yellow mustard, and mayonnaise); Angus Mushroom and Swiss (saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, two slices of Swiss cheese and mayonnaise); Angus Bacon and Cheese (bacon, two slices of American cheese, sliced red onions, yellow mustard, ketchup and pickles); and the Angus Chipotle BBQ Bacon (chipotle sauce, red onions, pickles, bacon, and two slices of American cheese). In Australia and New Zealand, there are three Angus burgers sold: the Grand Angus (which is a clone of the Angus Deluxe) and the Mighty Angus (which resembles the Angus Cheese and Bacon, but with no pickles and mayonnaise and onion relish replacing the ketchup and mustard). For a limited time only, the Angus The Third, similar to the Grand Angus, was sold, but with no mustard and made with a tomato chili relish and only one slice of cheese. Also, for a limited time, Angus the Great was sold, a clone of the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. In October 2012, an Angus version of the Cheddar Bacon Onion (CBO) Sandwich was made available, consisting of a horseradish-like sauce, grilled caramelized onions, bacon and cheddar cheese. In May 2013, McDonald's stopped selling the Angus burger.\nArch Deluxe \u2013 An attempt to produce a \"luxury\" hamburger, promoted by a high-profile advertising campaign (introduced in 1996), today considered one of the most expensive failures in McDonald's history. It featured a honey mustard-type sauce.\nBeef Wennington \u2013 A burger offered solely in the Chicago area in 1998\u20131999, named after former Chicago Bulls player Bill Wennington. It featured a single patty topped with cheese, onions, barbecue sauce and a slice of Canadian bacon.\nBoselli Burger \u2013 Jacksonville, Florida, franchises also featured the Triple-Double Burger in 1998, named after Jacksonville Jaguars tackle Tony Boselli.\nMcDLT \u2013 The McDLT (McDonald's Lettuce and Tomato) was sold in a novel form of packaging.\nMcLean Deluxe \u2013 A lower-calorie Quarter Pounder-type sandwich (introduced in 1991) containing 90% lean beef and 10% water with carrageenan, a seaweed extract, to hold the water and beef together.\nMickey D \u2013 A 1\u20443 lb (5+1\u20443 oz or 150 g) burger introduced in 1993 with cheddar cheese, red onions, diced tomatoes and a zesty tomato sauce on a crusty roll.\nCheddar Melt \u2013 A quarter pound beef patty smothered with grilled onions (sauteed in butter and teriyaki), then topped with cheddar cheese sauce on a light rye bun, offered in 1988, the 1990s, 2004, and 2007. They are still available in Brazil under the name Cheddar McMelt.\nMcAfrika \u2013 A sandwich that contained beef, cheese, and tomatoes wrapped in pita bread. McDonalds claimed it was based upon an authentic African recipe. Released in Denmark and Norway during 2002, with a sandwich similar in concept being sold during 2008.\n\nFish\nCatfish Sandwich \u2013 A sandwich made with a catfish patty, lettuce, and tangy sauce and sold on a McRib-style bun. Sold at McDonald's locations in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi for a brief period in March 1991.\n\nChicken\nChicken McBites \u2013 popcorn chicken breast with \"home-style seasoning\" offered through April 20, 2012, in three-ounce (85 g), five-ounce (140 g) and ten-ounce (280 g) versions. Dipping sauces include ranch, sweet n' sour, tangy BBQ, chipotle BBQ, and honey mustard.\n Chicken Selects \u2013 McDonald's version of chicken strips. They were introduced in early 1998 and offered again as a permanent part of the menu in late October 2003. They are sold in three-, five-, or ten-piece sizes and include choices of spicy buffalo, creamy ranch, honey mustard, and chipotle barbecue dipping sauces; sauce selections in the United Kingdom are smokey barbecue, sour cream and sweet chili sauce. Sold in the United States, Canada, Israel, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Available in Australia under the name Chicken McDippers. McDonald's stopped selling Chicken Selects in the United States in February 2013.\n\nOther sandwiches\nCuban Sandwich \u2013 Roast pork and ham sandwich on a long roll with Swiss cheese, mustard, and pickles. One of several Hispanic-inspired menu items briefly sold at South Florida units in 2001.\nFried Roast Beef Sandwich \u2013 In 1968 this product was launched targeting adults. Sold with a package of McDonald's BBQ sauce on the side using the slogan \"McDonald's is my kind of place\"; it was inspired by a franchisee's version of an Arby's sandwich. The sandwich failed due to the costs of getting roast beef slicers; no matter how many sandwiches they could sell, it would never turn a profit.\nHulaburger \u2013 A Ray Kroc invention, it featured a slice of pineapple instead of meat. Originally intended for Roman Catholics who are not allowed to eat meat on Fridays during Lent. It was test-marketed in 1963 alongside the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, with the highest seller being added to the menu full-time (the Filet-O-Fish, a creation of an Ohio franchiser, won).\nKiwiburger \u2013 In the 1990s, New Zealand sold a burger reflecting their national icon the Kiwi. It was a single beef patty hamburger, with egg (identical to the egg in McMuffins), cheese, lettuce, tomato, beetroot, onions, ketchup (\"tomato sauce\") and American mustard. It came in distinctive packaging with 46 classic Kiwi quotes, Kiwiana, and Kiwi sporting icons, which were also used in promotions of the burger.\n\nPizza & pasta\nDinner Menu \u2013 After testing pasta in the South in 1989, McDonald's began testing a pasta-based menu at 40 units across Rochester, New York, in September 1991, including lasagna, fettuccine alfredo, and spaghetti with meatballs. In the early 1990s, a new Dinner Menu was tested for 6\u201312 months at two locations in New York and Tennessee. It consisted of the pizza mentioned below but also included lasagna, spaghetti, fettuccine alfredo, and roasted chicken as other mains. The side dishes included mashed potatoes with gravy and a vegetable medley. For the dessert, it included a brownie \u00e0 la mode or peanut butter pie.\nPizza/McPizza \u2013 McDonald's has also attempted pizza at various times, with an apple-pie\u2013like McPizza and more conventional McDonald's Pizza. A line of personal-sized pizzas was first seen in the late 1970s in test-market stores near interstate highways around Milwaukee and Madison. In Canada (c. 1992\u201399), the pizza originally began as a family-sized pizza that was brought out to the table by an employee and placed on a raised rack in the centre of the table. Later it was scaled down to a personal-sized pizza. However, variations have found their way into some international markets such as India (the pie-like \"Pizza McPuff\"). McDonald's also test marketed a 14-inch, round, traditional-style pizza in Evansville, Indiana, and nearby Owensboro, Kentucky, in 1989. By 1991, the McDonald's test markets for pizza had grown to over 500 McDonald's locations before the pizza test was placed on hold. Pizza was discontinued in most restaurants by 1999. The reason for eliminating pizza from the menu was that it took 11 minutes to cook a pizza, and McDonald's wanted to keep its reputation for fast service. A decade later, two McDonald's locations, one in Pomeroy, Ohio, and the other in Spencer, West Virginia, still offered the family-style McPizza; the Ohio and West Virginia locations ceased serving pizzas in 2017. In November 2020, only the largest U.S. McDonald's, in Orlando, Florida, features pizza, pasta, and Belgian waffles.\n\nDrinks & desserts\nDiet Coke Float and Coke Float \u2013 In 1991 McDonald's ran a limited-time promotion selling a float made with Diet Coke or Coke with low-fat soft-serve frozen yogurt in a collectable Coke bell glass. It sold for $1.59 with 40 cents from every sale donated to Ronald McDonald Children's Charities.\nTriple Ripple \u2013 A mixed cone with strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate, topped with a plastic top.\n\nSee also\nList of Burger King products\n\nFurther reading\n\"$1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu Items\".

The traditional mix includes chervil, arugula, leafy lettuces and endive, while the term mesclun may also refer to a blend that might include some or all of these four and baby spinach, collard greens, Swiss chard (silver beet), mustard greens, dandelion greens, fris\u00e9e, mizuna, m\u00e2che (lamb's lettuce), radicchio, sorrel, or other fresh leaf vegetables.\n\nOrigins\nOn July 10, 1924, in Paris, Philippe Tiranty and Paul Gordeaux reunited with many friends at the Cochon d'Or (a famous restaurant in La Villette), decided to create the foyer des Amiti\u00e9s ni\u00e7oises, and to call it Lou Mesclun. For these comedians and humanists, this expression meant \"real living together\".The term mesclun for a mixture of young salad greens is quite recent, first used in 1976 according to Merriam-Webster.  Of Proven\u00e7al dialect origin, it derives from the verb mesclar, to \"mix thoroughly\" and literally means \"mixture\". According to local lore, mesclun originated with the farmers around Nice, who would each bring their own unique and prized mix of baby greens to the farmers' markets. One of the most representative and authentic versions combined baby dandelion, lettuce and rocket (arugula).Noted chef Alice Waters comments, \"Outdoor markets in Provence display mesclun in profusion, a melange of the first tender young leaves which appear in the garden. Mesclun can be an extraordinary lettuce mixture: rocket, much like the rugola (arugula) found in Italian markets, chervil, m\u00e2che or lamb's lettuce and oakleaf lettuce. On occasion, baby curly endive (chicory) or young dandelion greens find their way into the medley, depending solely upon the grower's personal preferences combined with the reality of whatever else might send up shoots in the spot where mesclun grows.\"\n\nSpring mix\nIn the North American foodservice industry, the first appearance of mesclun traces to restaurants and farm stands in the early 1980s, with a rise in popularity since. A mesclun mix can be described as comprising baby leaves of lettuces and other greens (and often herbs) in a wide range of leaf shapes, colors, textures and tastes. While the overwhelming amount of mesclun sold approximates the traditional blend of chervil, arugula, leafy lettuces and endive, depending on the season, anywhere from a dozen to three dozen different varieties of baby greens, including red and green oak leaves, romaine and lollo rossa lettuces, fris\u00e9e, tatsoi, bok choy (joi choi), arugula, spinach, orach, mizuna, dandelion, mustard greens and garden cress may compose what is commercially referred to as a \"spring mix\". When available, locally grown, direct-from-the-farmer sourcing is recommended over commercial bulk packs for best flavor and freshness.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Mesclun (French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u025bs\u02c8kl\u0153\u0303]) is a mix of assorted small young salad greens that originated in Provence, France.

The salad was unknown in South Korea until recently, when Russo-Koreans' return migration as well as Russian and Central Asian immigration became common.

In different modern recipes, it is usually made with diced boiled potatoes, carrots and brined dill pickles (or cucumber), together with optional vegetable or fruit ingredients such as green peas, eggs, celeriac, onions and apples, optional meat ingredients such as diced boiled chicken, bologna sausage, ham, or hot dogs, with salt, pepper and mustard sometimes added to enhance flavor, and dressed with mayonnaise. In many countries, the dish is commonly referred to as Russian salad, in Brazil it is called Maionese, in a few Scandinavian countries (Denmark and Norway) it is called italiensk salat (Italian salad, for the colours of the Italian flag are in the salad) and in Dutch it is called huzarensalade (hussars' salad). In former Yugoslavian countries it is called ruska salata (Russian salad) or francuska salata (French salad). In Romania it is known as \"salata (de) boeuf.\"In Russia and other post-Soviet states, as well as in Russophone communities worldwide, the salad has become one of the main dishes on zakuski tables served during New Year's Eve (\"Novy God\") celebrations.\n\nHistory\nThe original version of the salad was invented in the 1860s by a cook of Belgian origin, Lucien Olivier, the chef of the Hermitage, one of Moscow's most celebrated restaurants. Olivier's salad quickly became immensely popular with Hermitage regulars, and became the restaurant's signature dish.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, one of Olivier's sous-chefs, Ivan Ivanov, attempted to steal the recipe. While preparing the dressing one evening in solitude, as was his custom, Olivier was suddenly called away. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Ivanov sneaked into Olivier's private kitchen and observed his mise en place, which allowed him to make reasonable assumptions about the recipe of Olivier's famed dressing. Ivanov then left Olivier's employ and went to work as a chef for Moskva, a somewhat inferior restaurant, where he began to serve a suspiciously similar salad under the name \"metropolitan salad\" (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439, tr. Stolichny). It was reported by the gourmands of the time, however, that the dressing on the \"Stolichny\" salad was of a lower quality than Olivier's, meaning that it was \"missing something.\"Later, Ivanov sold the recipe for the salad to various publishing houses, which further contributed to its popularization. Due to the closure of the Hermitage restaurant in 1905, and the Olivier family's subsequent departure from Russia, the salad could now be referred to as \"Olivier.\"\nOne of the first printed recipes for Olivier salad, by Aleksandrova, appearing in 1894, called for half a hazel grouse, two potatoes, one small cucumber (or a large cornichon), 3\u20134 lettuce leaves, 3 large crayfish tails, 1/4 cup cubed aspic, 1 teaspoon of capers, 3\u20135 olives, and 11\u20442 tablespoon Proven\u00e7al dressing (mayonnaise).\nAs often happens with gourmet recipes which become popular, the ingredients which were rare, expensive, seasonal, or difficult to prepare were gradually replaced with cheaper and more readily available foods.\n\nIngredients\nThe earliest published recipe known to date appeared in the Russian magazine \u041d\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0449\u0430 (Nasha pishcha, \"Our Food\") No. 6 (31 March 1894). This magazine, published from 1891 to 1896 and edited by M. Ignatiev, stated that the original recipe contained \"mogul sauce\" or \"kabul sauce\" (similar to Worcestershire sauce), manufactured by John Burgess & Son (the brand he reputedly used) and Crosse & Blackwell.The book \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043a \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 (Rukovodstvo k izucheniyu osnov kulinarnogo iskusstva, \"Guide to the Fundamentals of Culinary Arts\") (1897) by P. Aleksandrova gave a recipe containing grouse, crayfish, potatoes, cucumber, lettuce, aspic, capers, olives and mayonnaise. The author wrote that veal, partridge or chicken could be substituted but the authentic recipe contained grouse.In post-revolutionary Russia, cheaper ingredients were substituted for the originals: grouse was replaced by chicken or sausage, crayfish by hard-boiled egg, cucumbers, olives and capers by pickled cucumbers and green peas.\nEarlier, it always included cold meat such as ham or veal tongue, or fish. The mid-20th century restaurant version involved not just vegetables, but also pickled tongue, sausage, lobster meat, truffles, etc. garnished with capers, anchovy fillets, etc. Some versions molded it in aspic.\nIn modern usage, it is usually boiled diced vegetables bound in mayonnaise, with Doktorskaya-type sausage. The most common alternative version, where the sausage is replaced with boiled or smoked chicken, is called Stolichny salad, after Ivanov's version.\nA multitude of other versions, named, unnamed, and even trademarked, exist, but only Olivier and Stolichny salad have entered the common vernacular of post-Soviet states.\n\nModern Olivier\nToday's popular version of Olivier salad\u2014containing boiled potatoes, dill pickles or fresh cucumbers, peas, eggs, carrots, onion and boiled beef/chicken or bologna, dressed with mayonnaise\u2014is a version of Ivanov's Stolichny salad, and only faintly resembles Olivier's original creation. This version was a staple of any Soviet holiday dinner, especially of a Novy God (New Year's Eve) dinner (to the extent that its presence was considered on a par with Soviet Champagne or mandarin oranges), due to availability of components in winter. Even though more exotic foods are widely available in Russia now, its popularity has hardly diminished: this salad was and maybe still is the most traditional dish for the home New Year celebration for Russian people.Festive Russian and post-Soviet states' homemade versions are traditionally at the cook's whim. While some of the ingredients are considered to be basic and essential, others are either favoured or dismissed as a threat to supposed authenticity.\nThe biggest Olivier salad, weighing 1841 kg, was prepared in December 2012 in Orenburg.\n\nIn other countries\nEuropean cafes and delicatessens often provide an entire range of potato salads. Additionally, cafeterias, convenience stores, and truck stops sell a number of sub-par factory packaged or locally made versions, mostly extremely simple, using basic ingredients with cheap mayonnaise-like dressing.\n\nSoutheast Europe\nIn Serbia Olivier salad is called russian salad and is very common on the New Year and Christmas table.\nThe salad is widely popular as \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 (ruska salata) in Bulgaria, Serbia, and North Macedonia, and sallat\u00eb ruse in Albania. The Bulgarian version of the salad usually consists of potatoes, carrots, peas, pickles and some sort of salami or ham. In Bosnia and Herzegovina both the ruska salata and francuska salata (which is essentially Russian salad prepared without meat) are very popular, especially during holidays.\nIn Croatia and Slovenia it is typically prepared without meat, and is usually called francuska salata in Croatian and francoska solata in Slovene, both meaning French salad.\nThe Romanian variant, called salat\u0103 de boeuf (\"beef salad\"), is considered a traditional dish. It is a combination of finely chopped beef (or chicken) and root vegetables, folded in mayonnaise and finished with mur\u0103turi, traditional Romanian mixed pickles. It can also be made vegetarian.\nIn Turkey it is known as Rus salatas\u0131 (\"Russian Salad\"). The Turkish version consists of boiled and sliced carrots and potatoes, sliced cucumber pickles, boiled peas and mayonnaise and is sometimes decorated with boiled and sliced eggs, black olives and beet root pickles. It is served as meze and is used as a filling for some sandwiches and kumpir (jacket potato). Another Turkish name for Olivier salad is Amerikan salatas\u0131 (\"American salad\"), a euphemistic misnomer originating from the Cold War period.\n\nCentral Europe\nIn Slovakia it is called zemiakov\u00fd \u0161al\u00e1t (\"potato salad\"). There are several versions; however, it typically consists of boiled and cubed vegetables (potatoes, carrots), finely chopped onions and pickles in a mayonnaise dressing, often with diced hard-boiled eggs and canned green peas. It is seasoned with salt, black pepper and mustard. Some fluid from the pickles may also be added.\nIn Czech it is called simply bramborov\u00fd sal\u00e1t (\"potato salad\"). It consists of boiled and cubed vegetables (potatoes, carrots, parsley and celery root), finely chopped onions and pickles in a mayonnaise dressing, often with diced hard-boiled eggs, some kind of soft salami and canned green peas. It is the side-dish of choice to go with schnitzel or breaded carp, staple Christmas meals in the Czech Republic.\n\nPolish sa\u0142atka jarzynowa or sa\u0142atka warzywna (\"vegetable salad\", often simply called sa\u0142atka) is vegetarian, consisting of peas, hard boiled eggs, and the mirepoix, always cut into small cubes, seasoned with mayonnaise, salt, pepper. Recipes usually vary by region (tart apples or pickles can be added) and even by household, sometimes even adding meat (e.g. ham). One such notable exception is sza\u0142ot (Polish pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0282aw\u0254t]), a Silesian variety which may include not only boiled potatoes, carrots, peas and boiled eggs, but also bacon, sausages or pickled herring. Such salads are often served on family celebrations, in particular on Christmas Eve.\nIn Hungary the meatless version is called \"Franciasal\u00e1ta\" (French Salad).\" Versions with meat added are called \"Orosz h\u00fassal\u00e1ta\"[2] (Russian meat salad). With or without meat, it is a popular food all year round.\n\nSouthern Europe\nIn Greece it can be found on almost any restaurant's menu and is called \u03c1\u03ce\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 (rossiki salata); it usually contains no meat. Ensaladilla rusa (\"Russian little salad\") is widely consumed in Spain and it is served as a tapa in many bars. It typically consists of minced boiled potato, minced boiled carrots, canned tuna, minced boiled eggs, peas, and mayonnaise. In Italy, Insalata russa has the same ingredients. A similar version is also popular in Portugal, where it is called salada russa. It is usually served either as a standalone dish or as a garnish to fish dishes, particularly fish fillets.\n\nNorthern Europe\nIn Denmark, Iceland and Norway it is called russisk salat, and contains carrots and green peas in mayonnaise dressing. It may also include small shrimp. Often the salad is paired with smoked meat on bread. A similar but distinct salad known as italiensk salat is also available in Scandinavian countries, consisting of shredded cabbage and carrots in a mayonnaise dressing. The two salads, russisk salat and italiensk salat, are often confused. In Finland, the regional salad italiansalaatti contains carrots, peas and ham in mayonnaise dressing but replaces potatoes with spaghetti or macaroni. In the Netherlands there is a similar salad called Huzarensalade (\"Hussar Salad\"), but this salad already existed in the 1840s. Its name probably derives from the Dutch hussar regiments, and refers to the original ingredient of horsemeat.\n\nAsia\nOlivier salad (Persian: \u0627\u0644\u0648\u064a\u0647) is popular in Iran, where it is known as salad Olivieh and usually made with potatoes, eggs, Persian pickled cucumbers, carrots, chicken, peas and mayonnaise, and is frequently a sandwich filler.\n\nIt is a popular salad in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India as well, where it is usually made with potatoes, peas, apples or pineapples, and mayonnaise and is frequently used as a side dish in cafes. Another version of Russian salad is also very popular in Pakistan which bears no resemblance to Olivier salad and instead is a cabbage and apple slaw.\nJapanese potato salad (potesara, \u30dd\u30c6\u30b5\u30e9), is often said to be a yoshoku version of the Olivier salad, differing in a semi-mashed consistency of the potato, chopped ham as a main meat ingredient (instead of traditional poultry) and a liberal use of rice vinegar and karashi mustard in its dressing.\nOlivier salad is believed to have been introduced as a \"Capital salad\" or \"Niislel salad\"  in Mongolia during the Soviet period. It usually consists of minced ham and carrots, minced boiled eggs, minced boiled carrots, and potatoes dressed with mayonnaise. It is widely popular amongst Mongolians, especially during the festive seasons.\n\nLatin America\nThe dish is also very popular in many Latin American countries where it is called ensalada rusa and has been reduced to its minimum: minced boiled potatoes and carrots, green beans and abundant mayonnaise-based dressing. In Argentina it is usually served on its own as a first course, or with a very thinly sliced beef wrapping called matambre, in a dish called matambre con rusa. Argentinians of Eastern European Jewish origin may make the salad with tuna. In Peru, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina it is a traditional Christmas side dish. In Dominican Republic, \u201csalad russe\u201d is made of diced boiled vegetables including beets, carrots, potatoes and sometimes corn, mixed with mayonnaise and spices. It is often served as a side dish.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n Media related to Olivier salad at Wikimedia Commons", "summary": "Olivier salad (Russian: \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442 \u041e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044c\u0435, tr. salat Olivye pronunciation ) is a traditional salad dish in Russian cuisine, which is also popular in other post-Soviet countries and around the world.

It was created by the Lao people and is a popular national dish of Laos. It also is a popular food in the neighbouring Northeastern region of Thailand and has gained its popularity in the country  and the rest of the continental Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam), as well as Xishuangbanna (China).\n\nHistory\nPapaya and chili peppers were introduced to Southeast Asia by the Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 17th century from the Americas. Simon de la Loub\u00e8re (1642-1729), a French diplomat, mentioned in his book that the cultivation of papaya was already widespread in Siam in 1693.\nAlthough it is unknown when papayas entered Laos specifically, they had already been integrated into Lao culture by the time of Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix's visit in 1836. Papaya, among other fruits, were cultivated in Cambodia by Chinese settlers who immigrated in the 1500s from Hainan, China. The Lao name for papaya is mak hung and was likely derived from l'hun or lohung/rohung as papayas are called by Cambodians and Cambodian indigenous people living in provinces bordering the Southeastern region of Laos. It is believed that green papaya salad, known as tam mak hung or tam som in Lao and as som tam in Thai, likely originated in Laos. \nThai historian Sujit Wongthes has speculated that the green papaya salad originated in the communities of ethnic Chinese\u2013Lao settlers living in what is now Central Thailand, who adopted the ancient Lao tradition of preparing salads from fruits, called tam som, to make salads from papayas. The new dish became known as som tam (the reversed order of tam som) during the early Rattanakosin period (late 18th to early 19th centuries) and, along with the papaya, then spread to today's Northeast Thailand following the construction of the Northeastern railway line during the turn of the 19th\u201320th centuries. The dish became more popular after the opening of Mittraphap Road in 1957, helping bring new papaya cultivars into the region, and has since become widely adopted by the ethnic Lao people of both Isan and Laos. Likewise, the hot flavour also spread to Isan and Laos from Central Thailand, which had been introduced to chilli peppers first.However, chilli peppers, like papayas, were already fully integrated in the Lao territory by the time French explorer Henri Mouhot visited Laos, in 1861, and also in the Lao traditional culinary recipes. Furthermore, during the 1950s and 1960s, green papaya salad and other Lao dishes were rarely known in Bangkok and could only be found around the boxing stadium that gathered boxers and fans from Northeastern Thailand, as well as in mobile food carts outside construction sites with workers from Northeastern Thailand and gas stations serving long-distance bus drivers. Some people believe that som tam, today\u2019s popular green papaya salad in Thailand, derived from the Lao tam som or tam mak hoong tradition that migrant workers from the Northeast had brought with them to Bangkok during the mid-1900s.  During the standardization of the Thai national cuisine, green papaya salad was among the Northeastern or Lao dishes to be included into the Thai national cuisine and modified by reducing the amount of chilli peppers and increasing the amount of sugar.Alternatively, others believe that som tam has evolved from a dish called \"Pu Tam\" (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e39\u0e48\u0e15\u0e33, lit.\u2009'Crab Salad') mentioned in a recipe by gourmet chef Plien Passakornwong in her 1908 cookbook. This dish shares similarities with modern-day som tam but does not include papaya as an ingredient. The earliest known recipe for som tam in Thailand appeared in the Yaowapha cookbook series by Phra Chao Boromawong in 1935, which included \"Som tam ton malakor\" (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e15\u0e33\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e21\u0e30\u0e25\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d) or \"Khao man som tam\" (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e15\u0e33). This recipe is similar to the som tam we know today and includes roasted peanuts and dried shrimp as key ingredients. It is often served with rice cooked in coconut milk.\n\nPreparation\nThe dish combines the five main basic tastes: sourness of the lime, the spiciness of the chili, saltiness and savoriness of the fish sauce, and sweetness of palm sugar. The ingredients are mixed and pounded in a mortar, which is reflected in the Khmer, Lao and Thai names for the dish that literally mean \"pounded papaya\".\nIn Laos, green papaya salad is one of the traditional staples of the Lao. Pounded salads in Laos all fall under the parent category of tam som, which may or may not contain green papaya, however, when no specific type of tam som is mentioned, it is generally understood to refer to green papaya salad. For absolute clarity, however, the name tam maak hoong may be used, since this name means \"pounded papaya\".\nIn Thailand, it is customary that a customer ask the preparer to make the dish suited to his or her tastes. To specifically refer to the original style of papaya salad as prepared in Laos or Isan, it is known as \u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e15\u0e33\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27 or som tam Lao or simply as tam Lao and the dish as prepared in central Thailand may be referred to as som tam Thai.\nTraditionally, the local variety of green papaya salad in the streets of Bangkok is very spicy due to the addition of a fistful of chopped hot bird's eye chili. However, with its rising popularity among tourists, it is now often served less spicy as it used to be in the past.\n\nAdditional ingredients\nTogether with the papaya, some or most of the following secondary items are added and pounded in the mortar with the pestle:\n\nAsparagus beans\nBrined \"rice field crabs\". These belong to the freshwater crab genera Sayamia, Chulathelphusa, and Esanthelphusa (previously classified as part of the genus Somanniathelphusa), which all belong to the Gecarcinucid crab subfamily Parathelphusinae. found in flooded rice fields and canals. Isan people eat the entire crab, including the shell.\nChili pepper\nDried shrimp\nFish sauce\nGarlic\nMonosodium glutamate\nHog plums\nLime slice and lime juice\nPalm sugar\nShrimp paste\nFish paste\nRaw Thai eggplant\nCherry or grape tomatoes (green or ripe)Green papaya salad is often served with glutinous rice and kai yang/ping gai (grilled chicken). It can also be eaten with fresh rice noodles or simply as a snack by itself with, for instance, crispy pork rinds. The dish is often accompanied by raw green vegetables such as water spinach and white cabbage wedges on the side to mitigate the spiciness of the dish.\n\nVariations\nIt is believed to have originated in Laos, from where it was exported into Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. Variations of the dish are found throughout Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and as well as in the West, where it is more commonly known by its Thai name.A non-spicy green papaya salad version also exists in Laos, Vietnam and Thailand, which is much sweeter; it often contains crushed peanuts and is less likely to have fish paste or brined crab. Dried brine shrimp are used in this Central Thai version. There are also versions that make use of unripe mangoes, apples, cucumbers, carrots and other firm vegetables or unripe fruit. Besides using varieties of fruits or vegetables as the main ingredient a popular option is to use vermicelli rice noodles wherein the dish is known as tam sua.Instead of papaya, other ingredients can be used as the main ingredient. Popular variations in Laos and Thailand include the salad with:\nCucumber, usually the small variety (tam maak taeng, tam taengkwa)\nGreen and unripe mango (tam maak muang, tam mamuang)\nGreen and unripe bananas (tam maak kuai, tam kluai)\nHard and unripe santol (tam krathon)\nBanana flowers (tam hua pli)\nMalay gooseberry (tam mayom)\nPomelo (tam som o)\nMu yo sausage (tam mu yo)\nMixed fruit (tam phonlamai ruam)\nCoconut rice (khao man som tam)\n\nReception\nThe Thai variation som tam has been listed at number 46 on World's 50 most delicious foods compiled by CNN Go in 2011 and 2018.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of fruit dishes\nList of salads\nAtchara\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nCummings, Joe.

The most popular variant in all three countries is a salad composed of a mixture of sliced fruit and vegetables served with a spicy palm sugar dressing. It is often described as tangy and spicy fruit salad due to its sweet, hot and spicy dressing made from ground chilli, palm sugar and peanuts.There is a diverse variety of preparations, especially in Indonesian cuisine, and rujak is widely available throughout Indonesia. While the most common variant is primarily composed of fruits and vegetables, its sweet and tangy dressing is often made with prawn paste. Some recipes may contain seafood or meat components, especially in Malaysia and Singapore where a notable variant shows influence from Indian Muslim cuisine.\n\nEtymology\nRujak is one of the oldest dishes and the earliest historically identified food of ancient Java. The word \"rujak\" came from the word rurujak in ancient Javanese Taji inscription (901 CE) from the era of Mataram Kingdom in Central Java.The dish was later introduced to other regions and neighboring countries by the Javanese diaspora, as well as Indian descents who had lived in Java. In Malaysia and Singapore, it is spelled as \"rojak\".\n\nCultural significance\nIn Indonesia, particularly among the Javanese, the sweet, spicy and sour tastes of rojak is popular among pregnant women; this craving for unripe mango and other sour-tasting fruits is known as \"ngidham\" or \"nyidham\" in Javanese. In Javanese culture, rujak is an essential part of the traditional prenatal ceremony called Naloni Mitoni or tujuh bulanan (literally: seventh month), and is meant to wish the mother-to-be a safe, smooth and successful labour. Special fruit rujak is made for this occasion, and later served to the mother-to-be and her guests, primarily her female friends. The recipe of rujak for this ceremony is similar to typical Indonesian fruit rujak, with the exceptions that the fruits are roughly shredded instead of thinly sliced, and that jeruk bali (pomelo/pink grapefruit) is an essential ingredient. It is believed that if the rujak overall tastes sweet, the unborn would be a girl, and if it is spicy, the unborn baby is a boy.Mangarabar, or rujak making, is a special event for the inhabitants of the Batak Mandailing region in Tapanuli, North Sumatra, Indonesia after the harvest. Normally the whole village will be involved in making and consuming the rujak.In Malaysia and Singapore, \"rojak\" is also used as a colloquial expression for an eclectic mix, in particular as a word describing the multi-ethnic character of Malaysian and Singaporean society.\n\nIndonesian rujak\nRujak Buah (fruit rujak)\nIn Indonesia, Rujak buah is also known as rujak manis (sweet rujak). The typical Indonesian fruit rujak consists of slices of assorted tropical fruits such as jambu air (water apple), pineapple, unripe mangoes, bengkoang (jicama), cucumber, kedondong and raw red ubi jalar (sweet potato). Sometimes Malang variants of green apple, belimbing (starfruit) and jeruk Bali (pomelo) are added. The sweet and spicy-hot bumbu rujak dressing is made of water, gula jawa (palm sugar), asem jawa (tamarind), crushed peanuts, terasi (prawn paste), salt, bird's eye chilli and red chilli. All of the fruits are cut to bite-size pieces, and put in the dish.The bumbu rujak or thick sweet spicy rujak dressing is poured on the fruit slices. An addition of sambal garam powder (a simple mixture of salt and ground red chilli) is put on side as the alternative for those who prefer a salty taste for their rujak. The Javanese people call this kind of rujak as lotis.\n\nRujak Cuka\nRujak cuka literally means \"vinegar rujak\". It is a speciality of Sundanese cuisine of West Java, noted for its sour freshness.

The fruits being ground are young/green pisang batu (a species of plantain), raw red yam, jicama, Java apple, kedondong and young unripe mango. The dressing is not poured on the fruit, but mashed together with all the ingredients. The dressing contains terasi prawn paste, palm sugar, salt and birds-eye chilli. Traditionally, rujak tumbuk is served in individual smaller portions on banana leaf plates called pincuk. However today, it is also commonly served in plastic cups.\n\nRujak Serut\nThis literally means \"shredded rujak\", and is another variant of Indonesian fruit rujak.

Aside from unripe fruits the rojak also includes fried tofu, fried garlic and optionally beef tendons.

This dish was originated from the Chinese community in Batavia (now Jakarta) and now has become a Betawi dish closely related with Asinan Betawi.\n\nRujak Shanghai\nNamed after \"Bioscoop Shanghay\" (a cinema named after Shanghai, China's most populated city) In Batavia Kota area, this dish was created by Indonesia's Chinese community. This variant of rujak can be found in Indonesian Chinatowns in cities such as Glodok in Jakarta. Rujak Shanghai contains seafood, like Rujak Juhi. Boiled sliced gurita (octopus) and edible jellyfish are served with kangkung, and served with thick red sweet and sour sauce, mixed with pineapple juice, and toasted crushed peanuts.

This fashion was started by the restaurateur and food writer George Rector, who in 1936 wrote a column entitled \"Salad Daze\". In that column, he recommended using an unvarnished wooden salad bowl, purportedly a French tradition. He recommended rubbing garlic into it for a hint of garlic flavor, oiling it regularly, and never washing it:\n...age has everything to do with the bowl.... Wood, you see, is absorbent, and after you\u2019ve been rubbing your bowl with garlic and anointing it with oil for some years, it will have acquired the patina of a Corinthian bronze and the personality of a 100-year-old brandy.\n...Thirty years of sheer joy have oiled and polished and savored it until it is as distinguished an object as a 2,000-year-old Chinese shrine made of sandalwood.\nBy that Christmas season, wooden salad bowls had become a fashionable gift item, and by 1949, the cultural critic Russell Lynes was saying that a highbrow person \"wouldn't dream of washing his salad bowl\".The wooden salad bowl was criticized soon thereafter, even if it had a finish:\n\nThe finish on cheap and badly made bowls will soon crack, the oil will seep into the crevices and eventually go rancid, and if garlic is rubbed frequently over the surface, the desirable faint undertone will soon become an objectionable odor that can only be described as a stench.\nLarge wooden salad bowls, we are so often and authoritatively told, become seasoned with constant use, particularly if they are never washed. But it must be pointed out that the bowl, sooner or later, will develop imperceptible cracks, oil and food particles will inevitably collect in the cracks and become rancid.\n\nUse\nRubbing garlic on the salad bowl has a long history:\n\n...frott[er] le saladier avec de l'ail qu'on \u00e9crase avec une cro\u00fbte de pain nomm\u00e9e Chapon.\nrub the salad bowl with garlic crushed with a crust of bread called a \"capon\" Even in the United States, this predates Rector: an American salad cookbook from 1926 recommends it in many recipes.\n\nShape\nSalad bowls may be of any shape and size, from very flat to very tall.\n\n\n== Notes ==", "summary": "A salad bowl is a bowl-shaped serving dish used to serve salads, especially tossed salads.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Apple_bitten.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Salad_bowl%2C_Chantilly_Porcelain_Factory%2C_c._1735-1740%2C_soft-paste_porcelain_-_Wadsworth_Atheneum_-_Hartford%2C_CT_-_DSC05417.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg"]}, {"pageid": 53301615, "title": "Salade cauchoise", "text": "Salade cauchoise (French pronunciation: \u200b[salad ko\u0283waz]) is a traditional potato and celery salad of the cuisine of the Pays de Caux, Normandy, France.

The dish includes a wide range of flavours and colours and textures on a single plate. Often recipes allow the cook to add various ingredients which may be available at hand, producing many variations of the dish. Flowers from broom and sweet violet were often used.\n\nEtymology\nThere is debate over the sense and origin of the word. The word salmagundi may be derived from the obscure 16th century French word salmigondis which means disparate assembly of things, ideas or people, forming an incoherent whole. It may also come from the Italian phrase salami conduit (pickled meat). In Thomas Blount's Glossographia (1656), salamagundi is described as \"a dish of meat made of cold Turkey and other ingredients\". Helen Sabeeri points out that the essential root word of salmigondis is 'sal- (salt or seasoning) and that the dish is 'usually a fish of some sort'. It seems to appear in English for the first time in the 17th century as a dish of cooked meats, seafood, vegetables, fruit, leaves, nuts and flowers and dressed with oil, vinegar and spices. Salmagundi is used figuratively in modern English to mean 'any miscellaneous mixture or assortment'. Salmagundi was a popular dish with pirates and buccaneers of the Caribbean West Indies.\n\nHistory\nSeventeenth century\nLate in the seventeenth century, the name salmagundi was applied to the grand salads of large houses. These compound salads descended from medieval herb and flower salads. Raw salads, according to food historian C. Anne Wilson, 'had never come under the same sort of disapproval as fresh fruit, partly because so many salad plants were thought to have medicinal properties. Moreover, in a skilfully mixed salad, aromatic herbs noted for their warm, dry qualities, could counteract the coldness of other kinds, such as lettuce, purslane or endive'. During the reign of Elizabeth I fruits and vegetables and hard-boiled eggs were added to them.\n\nEighteenth-century recipes\nAn early recipe for salmagundi comes from A Collection of Above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick, and Surgery: For the Use of All Good Wives, Tender Mothers, and Careful Nurses by Mary Kettiby (1734):\n\nTo make a Cold Hash, or Salad-Magundy. TAKE a cold Turkey, two cold Chickens, or, if you have neither, a piece of fine white Veal will  do; cut the Breasts of these Fowls into fair dices, and Mince all the rest; to the Quantity of two Chickens you must take eight or ten large Anchovies, wash and bone them, eight large pickled Oysters, ten or twelve fine green pickled Cucumbers, shred the Oysters, the Anchovies, the Cucumbers, and one whole Lemon small, mix them with the shred Meat, lay it in the middle of the Dish, lay the Dices of the white part round the Dish, with halv'd Anchovies, whole pickled Oysters, quarter'd Cucumbers, sliced Lemon, whole pickled Mushrooms, Capers or any Pickle you like; cut also some fine Lettice, and lay round among the Garnish, but put not Oil and Vinegar to the Minced Meat, till it comes to Table.\nA later recipe for salmagundi from The Lady's Assistant for Regulating and Supplying Her Table by Charlotte Mason (1777) includes roasted chicken or roasted veal, boiled eggs, parsley, a herring, anchovies, beetroot and red cabbage. A saucer or china bason in placed in the middle of a dish and the ingredients are laid in rows, 'according to taste', the rows get narrower towards the top of the bowl. At the top butter.\"\n\nQuote\nSalmagundi is more of a concept than a recipe. Essentially, it is a large composed salad that incorporates meat, seafood, cooked vegetables, raw vegetables, fruits, and nuts and is arranged in an elaborate way. Think of it as the British answer to Salad Ni\u00e7oise.\u2014\n\nSee also\nList of salads\nJamaican fish paste.

Generally considered a localized dish derived from the Olivier salad, it originated from Western cuisine but was modified according to the customary taste of Shanghai people.\n\nHistory\nOrigin (The first half of the 20th century)\nAfter the forced opening in 1840s, Western restaurants began to be set up in Shanghai. In order to adapt to Chinese tastes, these  restaurants absorbed the essence of different Western culinary traditions and improved their dishes, resulting in a unique Haipai cuisine during the first half of the 20th century.  Shanghai-style salad is a fusion of Russian potato salad (Olivier salad) and local tastes and ingredients.Modified potato salad first appeared in the early 20th century in Russian restaurants owned by Russians who escaped from the Soviet Union after the October Revolution. However, the origin of the term \u201cShanghai-style salad\u201d is not clearly documented. In the 1930s, \"Shanghai Potato Salad\" appeared on the menu of the Chez Louis Restaurant (Chinese: \u559c\u4e50\u610f\u897f\u83dc\u793e), known as the famous Haipai western Red House Restaurant today, with much the same recipe as today. After that, the dish became popular in Western restaurants in Shanghai.\n\nDevelopment in PRC (after 1949)\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China, especially during the Cultural Revolution, the number of western restaurants sharply declined. However, Shanghai-style salad didn't die out with the decline of Western restaurants, but has migrated from high-end restaurants to the tables of ordinary residents. Today, Deda and Red House Restaurant are the few state-run western restaurants that still offer Shanghai-style salad made in the traditional way. While in Sanlin and some other delicatessens, Shanghai residents can buy the dish at a low price.\n\nCommon ingredients\nShanghai-style salad's common ingredients are diced Hongchang sausage, diced boiled potatoes, carrots and peas. The mixed sauce that Shanghai salad uses differs from that of Olivier salad and makes Shanghai salad special and better accepted by the local community. Traditional Shanghai salad uses a handmade sauce made from combining egg yolk, olive oil, white pepper and white vinegar in a specific order instead of ready-made mayonnaise. This sauce reflects a combination of Chinese and foreign cooking methods.In recent years, people also use Thousand Island dressing or mayonnaise as a simplified version of the traditional Shanghai salad sauce, but other ingredients remain the same.\n\nVendors\nThe Shanghai Deda Western food restaurant, founded in 1897, is one of the oldest and most famous vendors for Shanghai-style salad, and still serves it today.  Another eatery, Cathay Hotel (now known as Peace Hotel), also began serving Shanghai Salad in 1938 according to their menu, which is regarded as a symbol of the influence of Russian-style cuisine in Shanghai.Another famous restaurant in Shanghai that serves Shanghai-style Salad is the Red House, which was previously a French restaurant called Chez Louis Bar.\n\nHealth concerns\nMayonnaise, the primary ingredient of Shanghai-style salad, has been linked to health-related issues such as high cholesterol and high fat. This has resulted in food researchers focusing on trying to replace the high fat ingredients as well as egg yolk; however, this replacement means that extra ingredients are required to act as a stabilizer. A popular substitute for mayonnaise is ordinary salad sauce which can be purchased in most supermarkets in Shanghai, however this ingredient faces the same health concerns as mayonnaise.\n\nCultural impact\nShanghai salad, first introduced by overseas Russians, witnessed a special period in Shanghai when Western and Eastern cultures fused together. To better accommodate the stomach of Chinese people, modifications were made. For example, the traditional cold potatoes sometimes were replaced by hot ones. As the time went by, the salad, together with Shanghai-style borscht and Shanghai-style fried pork chops, became a standing dish that symbolized Haipai cuisine on the dining tables of Shanghai households.Shanghai salad can also be regarded as an epitome of the cultural fusion that took place during the nineteenth century, and this characteristic of Shanghai-style salad is mentioned in the book called \"Shanghai Salad\" by Chen Danyan.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Shanghai-style salad (Chinese: \u4e0a\u6d77\u8272\u62c9; pinyin: sh\u00e0ng h\u01cei s\u00e8 l\u0101; Wade\u2013Giles: shang4-hai3-se4-la1) is a traditional appetizer in Haipai cuisine.

Cookbook author Jila Dana-Haeri describes it as a refreshing dish during the summer.Shirazi salad has been described as being akin to a national salad in Iran, and it is a common meal accompaniment. It may also be used in a manner similar to that of a condiment, to reduce the spiciness of stews. It typically has a crisp and moist texture, and is somewhat similar to pico de gallo and Israeli salad.\n\nIngredients\nThe primary ingredients of Shirazi salad consist of small, finely-diced cucumber, tomato and onion, which is mixed with verjuice (or sometimes fresh lemon or lime juice) and some dried mint. Olive oil, salt, and pepper may be used, and additional ingredients may include chopped mint, parsley, scallions, dill, sumac, and red vinegar. The salad may have a sour and salty flavor, and its flavor may increase after being set for an hour or longer before serving, which allows time for the flavors to intermingle. It may be served with breads such as pita and lavash, or with cheese and/or walnuts.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nOnion, Medium Spring; Sliced, Thinly (May 5, 2013). \"Shirazi Salad\".

This is Bulgaria's most famous salad and national dish, whose colors recall the Bulgarian flag.\n\nRecipe\nIt is made from tomatoes, cucumbers, onion/scallions, raw or roasted peppers, sirene (white brine cheese), and parsley. The vegetables are usually diced and salted, followed by a light dressing of sunflower oil (or olive oil, which is less authentic), which is occasionally complemented by vinegar. The addition of vinegar contributes, however, to the sour flavour that the tomatoes impart. In restaurants, the dressings are provided separately. Lastly, the vegetables are covered in a thick layer of grated or diced sirene cheese. This salad is often consumed as an appetizer with rakia.\n\nHistory\nBalkantourist invention\nFor the first time the term \"Shopska salad\" was used in a Bulgarian cookbook from 1940. It was actually used for a recipe of some kind of lyutenitsa, and had nothing to do with the subsequent use of this designation. The salad was created as a culinary product in the state tourist agency \"Balkantourist\" in 1955. Despite the fact that the salad's name comes from the westernmost Bulgarian region called Shopluk, it was actually invented in its easternmost region. The salad appeared at the Black Sea coast, in a resort near Varna, called Druzhba. It can be found in one of the first state-approved cookbooks from 1956 (Sbornik recepti 1956, vol. 1, p. 50).  The development and popularization of the salad is attributed to the doyen of Bulgarian tourism Petar Doychev (1924-2019). It is a product of early organized tourism in Bulgaria, and part of tourist promotion, the only survivor of five or six similar recipes. The ingredients used were chosen in part because they resemble the three colors of the Bulgarian flag, and thus would evoke a national sentiment. The salad had become initially an emblem of the Bulgarian tourism. It was approved as a national culinary symbol during the 1970s and 1980s. In 2014 Shopska salad turned out to be Bulgaria's most recognizable dish in Europe. It was the most popular recipe in a European Parliament initiative called A Taste of Europe.\n\nOrigin dispute\nFrom Bulgaria, the recipe spread to the cuisine of neighboring countries. Because the area of Shopluk is divided among Bulgaria, Serbia and North Macedonia, After the breakup of Yugoslavia chefs there began to contest the Bulgarian origin of the salad. It is claimed as a local product even in Croatia. Though, Miroslav Stefanovi\u0107 (Maystor Miro), a four-time Serbian gastronomy chef champion, who owns the most popular chain Serbian restaurants in Bulgaria, is adamant that the Shopska salad is Bulgarian. It is also widely known in Romania under the name Bulgarian salad.\n\nSee also\n\u00c7oban salatas\u0131, a similar salad in Turkish cuisine\nGreek salad, a similar salad in Greek cuisine\nIsraeli salad\nKachumber\nSerbian salad\nShirazi salad\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Shopska salad (Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian: \u0428\u043e\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430; Croatian: \u0160opska salata; Romanian: Salata bulg\u0103reasc\u0103; Czech: \u0160opsk\u00fd sal\u00e1t; Polish: Sa\u0142atka szopska; Albanian: Sallat\u00eb Shope; Hungarian: Sopszka sal\u00e1ta; Greek: \u03a3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1) is a cold salad popular throughout Southeastern Europe.

It originated with the Meitei-culture but has been widely adopted by most of the ethnic communities of the state and in some neighbouring states of Northeast India. Often served as a spicy side dish, it is also a popular as an afternoon or evening snack.\nGiven that its main ingredient are seasonal vegetables, Singju has many variations. However, there are two main types: Ngari-based and Thoiding-Besan based.\nNgari is a kind of fermented fish, the flavor of which forms the backbone Manipuri cuisine. Roasted Ngari-based Singju is more popular in all homes, however it is not usually sold by local Singju vendors due high cost of Ngari. The Thoiding-Besan version therefore is more widely available from Singju vendors. Thoiding is an oily seed obtained from the plant Perilla frutescens which when roasted gives a nutty flavor. A mixture of roasted thoiding and roasted besan give a delicious flavor that is distinctive to Singju.  This latter non-Ngari version is also served in religious feasts where fish is prohibited.\n\nHistory\nManipur, being one of the most ancient independent kingdoms of South Asia, before becoming a part of India in 1949, has many distinctive local customs and traditions, owing to various influences throughout time. The word \"Singju\" comes from two words - \"Manaa-Masing\" and \"Suba\". \"Manaa-Masing\" means green vegetables and \"Suba\" means combining. Therefore, in rapid pronunciation the word \"Manaa-Masing\" drops to \"Sing\" and the word \"Suba\" transform to \"Ju\" for the better pronouncement. As a result, the word, \"Singju\" was born.\n\nPreparation\nSingju is a versatile dish that may be made vegetarian or non-vegetarian. There are two distinct ways to prepare singju.\n\nVeggie Singju\nA veggie singju is mainly served in ritual feasts of the Meitei people which are observed at home courtyards or shrine yards, or community complexes. It can be eaten at family homes too, but typically people prefer the non-veg versions in a non-ritual context.\nIn this form of the dish, the main ingredients are perilla seeds (thoiding in Meitei), chanaa powder, salt, chillies and various green leafy vegetables (compatible vegetables are listed below).\n\nNon-veg Singju\nA non-veg version of singju is mainly eaten at home, and widely sold in restaurants all over Manipur, and in some other areas of India as well. The tag \"non-veg\" is because of the use of the fermented fish ingredient Ngari. Because of this, it can not be served at ritual feasts of the community, which must be vegetarian.\nIn this type, the main ingredients are Ngari (a Manipuri form of fermented fish), salt, chillies and green leafy vegetables (compatible vegetables' list are listed below).\n\nCommon Singju Vegetable Ingredients\nAny vegetable can be used to make singju, but some are more popular than others. \nPopular additions include:\n\nLotus stem (Thambou in Meitei)\nStink Bean (Yongchaak)\nCabbage (Kobiful)\nCauliflower (Kobi-Lei)\nHawai Debi or Tebi\nHawai Maton\nUnripe Papaya (Awaa Thabi)\nBanana Flower (Laphu Tharo)\nRice Bean (Chakhawai)\nOnion (Tilhou)\n\nMorok Metpa or Ametpa\nMorok Metpa or Ametpa is another singju like dish. Morok means chilli and Metpa/Ametpa meaning crush. It is traditionally eaten along with daily meals at home but are not served at rituals. Like singju, it can be prepared in two ways, veg and non-veg, the former is usually eaten during the mourning period until the shraddha ceremony (for Meiteis) or the janazah ceremony (for Pangals) or after the burial ceremony (for Meitei Christians) or on days when people skip any type of fish/meat due to religious beliefs. It is usually made by frying red chillies, chives and onions as opposed to the usual steamed or roasted fermented fish and chillies eaten every day.\n\nSee also\nManipuri cuisine\nEromba\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Singju (Meitei: \uabc1\uabe4\uabe1\uabc1\uabe8; pronounced sing-zoo) is a dish from Manipur.

Water spinach thrives in the waterways, rivers, lakes and swamps of tropical Southeast Asia and Southern China. The garlic and shallots or onion are stir-fried in cooking oil, then the cleaned and cut water spinach are added, stir-fried in a wok on a strong fire with a small amount of cooking oil. The stir-frying lightly caramelises the vegetables. The seasoning sauce is added according to each preference and recipe. Some might add slices of red hot chili pepper for spicy tanginess, while fresh or dried shrimp might be added for flavour. Other recipes might add diced tofu.\n\nSeasonings and variations\nThe stir-fried water spinach might vary according to its seasonings. A stir-fried water spinach could be lightly seasoned in garlic, black pepper, fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, or in spicy chili pepper, tauco (fermented soybean paste), shrimp paste or other sauce. \nThe Vietnamese version use either fish sauce or oyster sauce for seasoning, while the Indonesian and Malaysian version seems to favour shrimp paste. The Filipino version often uses a soy sauce-vinegar seasoning mix, reminiscent of the Philippine adobo seasoning; with versions that also use shrimp paste, fish sauce, or fermented fish. The Southern Chinese recipe might favour oyster sauce or fermented tofu (\u8150\u4e73) seasoning. In West Java, the Chinese Indonesian version however, favours the use of tauco fermented soybeans paste as seasoning. In Burmese cuisine, stir-fried water spinach is typically fried with diced mushrooms, garlic, onions, and fresh chilies, and seasoned with oyster sauce, chicken stock, sesame oil, and salt.\n\nWater spinach with shrimp paste\nA specific preparation of water spinach stir-fried with shrimp paste (belacan in Malay; terasi in Indonesian; and bagoong alamang in Filipino) is called kangkung belacan or kangkong belacan in Malaysia and Singapore, cah kangkung terasi in Indonesia, and binagoongang kangk\u00f3ng in the Philippines. It is a popular vegetable dish in Maritime Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, the shrimp paste can also be replaced with bagoong isda (fermented fish) or patis (fish sauce) and is commonly served with deep-fried pork belly (lechon kawali).\n\nSee also\nPlecing kangkung\nMie kangkung\nBinagoongan\nMallung\nCrispy kangk\u00f3ng\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Stir-fried water spinach is a common Asian vegetable dish, known by various names in Asian languages.

Some variations add lettuce, or use semolina instead of bulgur.Tabbouleh is traditionally served as part of a mezze in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Arab world. Like hummus, baba ghanoush, pita bread, and other elements of Arab cuisine, tabbouleh has become a popular food in the United States.\n\nEtymology\nThe Levantine Arabic tabb\u016ble is derived from the Arabic word t\u0101bil from the Aramaic root word t-b-l, meaning \"seasoning\" or more literally \"dip\". Use of the word in English first appeared in the 1950s.\n\nHistory\nEdible herbs known as qa\u1e0db formed an essential part of the Arab diet in the Middle Ages. Dishes like tabbouleh attest to their continued popularity in Middle Eastern cuisine today. Originally from the mountains of Lebanon and Syria, tabbouleh has become one of the most popular salads in the Middle East. The wheat variety salamouni cultivated in the Beqaa Valley region in Lebanon, was considered (in the mid-19th century) as particularly well-suited for making bulgur, a basic ingredient of tabbouleh. In Lebanon, the Lebanese National Tabbouleh Day is a yearly festivity day dedicated to Tabbouleh. Since 2001, it is celebrated the first Saturday of the month of July.\n\nRegional variations\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq, it is usually served as part of a meze. The Syrian and the Lebanese use more parsley than bulgur wheat in their dish. A Turkish variation of the dish known as k\u0131s\u0131r, and a similar Armenian dish known as eetch use far more bulgur than parsley. Another ancient variant is called terchots. In Cyprus, where the dish was introduced by the Lebanese, it is known as tambouli. In the Dominican Republic, a local version introduced by Syrian and Lebanese immigrants is called Tipile. It is widely popular in Israel.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\nList of vegetable dishes\nK\u0131s\u0131r\nEetch\nFattoush\nCouscous\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nReferences\n\nMediterranean cuisine at Curlie", "summary": "Tabbouleh (Arabic: \u062a\u0628\u0648\u0644\u0629, romanized: tabb\u016bla), also transcribed tabouleh, tabbouli, tabouli, or taboulah, is a Levantine salad made mostly of finely chopped parsley, with tomatoes, mint, onion, soaked uncooked bulgur, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and sweet pepper.

In Thai cuisine these are called yam, tam, lap and phla. A few other dishes can also be regarded as being a salad.\n\nOverview\nThai salads often do not have raw vegetables or fruit as their main ingredient but use minced meat, seafood, or noodles instead. Similar to salads in the West, these dishes often have a souring agent, usually lime juice, and feature the addition of fresh herbs and other greens in their preparation. Thai salads are not served as entr\u00e9es but are normally eaten as one of the main dishes in a Thai buffet-style meal, together with rice (depending on the region, this can be glutinous rice or non-glutinous rice) or the Thai rice noodle called khanom chin. Specialised khao tom kui (plain rice congee) restaurants also serve a wide variety of Thai salads of the yam type as side dishes. Many Thai salads, for instance, the famous som tam, are also eaten as a meal or snack on their own.\n\nVarieties\nYam\nYam (\u0e22\u0e33, Thai pronunciation: [j\u0101m]) literally means \"mix,\" but in Thai cuisine, it usually refers to a type of salad-like dishes in the culinary repertoire of Thailand. Yam can be made with a wide variety of ingredients as its main ingredient. Nearly any type of protein, vegetable, fruit, herb, spice, and noodle, or combinations thereof, is possible. The main ingredient can be raw, pickled, fermented, sun-dried, smoked, steamed, parboiled, boiled, grilled, baked, stir-fried, deep-fried, or combinations. Besides the main ingredient, the basic recipe of a yam will nearly always contain sliced fresh shallots or onions, fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and fresh or dried chillies. When herbs are used, it is usually Chinese celery, sometimes in combination with other fresh herbs such as spearmint, coriander leaves, spring onions and culantro. Very often, sliced tomatoes are also added in, or finely sliced fresh spices such as lemongrass, ginger, galangal, or khamin khao (lit. \"white turmeric\").\n\nExamples of yam style salads are yam nuea yang with sliced grilled beef, yam khai dao with fried egg, yam tale with mixed seafood, yam mu yo with a pork sausage resembling liverwurst, or yam wunsen with glass noodles. Some yam salads can use only herbs, spices, and nuts as their main ingredient, such as yam takhrai met mamuang himaphan with sliced lemongrass and cashew nuts, or with stir-fried vegetables, such as water mimosa in yam phak krachet. Depending on the salad, anything from crispy fried onions, crunchy nuts, or seeds to toasted coconut flakes can also be added to the mix to enhance the flavours, colours and textures. Also, in many yam salads where the main ingredient is not meat, cooked minced pork can be added for extra savouriness, as often happens in yam wunsen (glass noodle salad). After one look at the menu of a khao tom kui (plain rice congee) restaurant, it is clear that nearly any ingredient that one can imagine can be used to make a yam style salad. To name a few: yam khai khem (salted duck eggs), yam kung chiang (dry Chinese sweet pork sausage), yam mu krop (Chinese crispy pork), and yam phak kat dong (Chinese pickled cabbage). These yam that are eaten with plain rice congee tend to remain more simple in their preparation, containing only the basic \"dressing\" of lime juice, raw onion or shallot, chillies, sugar, and fish sauce in addition to the main ingredient, with only some celery added where needed.A few types of yam need special mention as they differ somewhat from the basic recipe as mentioned above:\n\nYam naem khao thot (also known as naem khluk) is a salad made from crushed, deep-fried ball-shaped croquettes made from sticky rice and curry paste as the main ingredient, tossed together with shredded fermented pork sausage, and mixed with peanuts, crushed dried chilies, lime juice, sliced shallots, and fresh herbs, and served with a selection of fresh greens and additional herbs on the side.\nYam thawai is an elaborate salad made with chicken and a wide selection of vegetables, such as banana flowers, eggplant, string beans, bamboo shoots and bean sprouts, blanched briefly in coconut milk, and then served together with a creamy curry-like dressing.\nYam pla duk fu or pla duk fu yam mamuang is deep-fried flaked catfish meat served with a dressing made with thinly sliced unripe mango, shallots, chillies, lime juice, sugar and fish sauce.\nYam kung ten or just kung ten is a salad made with tiny translucent freshwater shrimp. The novelty of this dish is that a spicy lime dressing is first placed at the bottom of a bowl, which is then filled to the brim with the live shrimp and closed off with a lid when the lid is opened by an unsuspecting dinner guest, some of the small wriggling shrimp jump out of the bowl. Kung ten literally means \"dancing shrimp\". Shaking the bowl mixes the live shrimp with the sour dressing, which kills them.\nNorthern Thai yam do not follow the usual Thai yam dressing in that they tend not to be sour. Many are soup-like in appearance and resemble cold vegetable, meat, or fish stews. They are made similarly to a salad, combining the separate (cold) ingredients into one dish with fresh herbs. A sauce made from boiled, fermented fish is often used as a flavouring.\nYam som o, a yam made with pomelo, can utilise a different dressing altogether than a standard yam. As the pomelo, a citrus fruit is already naturally tart, the dressing can be sweet and/or creamy. It is, therefore, that recipes often make use of palm sugar, tamarind, and coconut milk to complement the taste of the pomelo.\nYam salat is commonly used to denote Western salads in Thai, usually to refer to salads that use mayonnaise in the dressing.\nYam maeng da is made from grilled horseshoe crab and only the eggs are eaten. It has a nutty and strong fishy taste.\n\nTam\nThe most famous, and for many also the original, tam (\u0e15\u0e33, pronounced [t\u0101m]), lit. \"pounded\") style salad is som tam, made from unripe papaya. The basic dressing for a som tam-style salad contains garlic, palm sugar, lime juice, bird's-eye chillies, dried shrimp and fish sauce. This dressing is slightly pounded and mixed inside an earthenware mortar using a wooden pestle. With certain kinds of tam, some or all of the additional ingredients will be pounded slightly if this helps release the flavours. Though with dishes such as tam phonla mai (fruit) or tam mu yo (a sausage similar to liverwurst), the main ingredients are mixed in with the dressing. Many types of tam salads will also contain (sliced) tomatoes.Northern Thai tam are quite different altogether. Most of these dishes do not use lime, tamarind juice, or vinegar in their dressing, thereby lacking the sour element seen in many salads. Tam makhuea is made from mashed grilled eggplant, grilled shallots and garlic, roasted chillies, fish, and shrimp paste and served with mint and boiled egg. It is somewhat similar to other eggplant salads from around the world, such as baba ghanoush. Further removed from what would still be viewed as a salad in the West is the northern Thai tam khanun, made with a mashed boiled whole baby jackfruit, dried chillies, minced pork stir-fried with a chilli paste, cherry tomatoes, fresh kaffir lime leaves, and coriander leaves. Another traditional salad from northern Thailand is tam khai mot daeng, made with the eggs of the red ant. Phak phai (Vietnamese mint) is one of the more unusual herbs used in this salad. A tam style salad from northern Thailand that is also famous in the rest of Thailand, is tam som-o (pomelo salad), in which the slightly pounded flesh of a pomelo is mixed with garlic, sliced lemongrass, and a thick pungent black paste (nam pu) made from boiling down the juices and meat of rice-paddy crabs.\n\nLap\nLap or larb (\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a, pronounced [l\u00e2\u02d0p]) is one of the internationally most well-known salads from Laos. The spicy, sweet, and very tart style of lap from Laos and northeastern Thailand is made with a dressing of lime juice, fish sauce, ground dried chillies, sugar, and, very importantly, khao khua, ground dry roasted glutinous rice which gives this salad its specific nutty flavour. Coriander leaves and chopped spring onions finish off the dish. Lap is most commonly made with minced pork or minced chicken, but in Thailand, lap pla, with fish, is also popular. Nam tok is a derivative of lap where the meat is sliced and not minced.\nNorthern Thai lap is a very different type of dish. As with the northern Thai tam, no souring agent is used in these dishes. Especially the versions using stir-fried minced meat (lap khua) more resemble a \"normal\" meat dish than a salad; but, as with salads, different ingredients, including fresh herbs and spices, are freshly mixed to form the dish. Other versions of this northern Thai speciality use raw meat or fish.\n\nPhla\nPhla (\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32, pronounced [p\u02b0l\u00e2\u02d0]) style salads can be made with a variety of proteins but not thoroughly cooked (rare to medium). Popularly used are pork (phla mu), prawns (phla kung) or beef (phla nuea). The basic dressing is very much the same as a yam but with a difference. In addition to the fish sauce, lime juice, chillies, and shallots or onions, a phla style salad will also always contain large amounts of thinly sliced lemongrass and mint. Additional fresh herbs, such as coriander leaves, can also be added to the mix. Some versions are made with grilled pork or beef, other versions will also have nam phrik phao, a sweet roasted chilli paste mixed in with the dressing. This last version is popular with squid (phla pla muek) and with prawns.\n\nOthers\nThe following dishes can also be regarded as salads:\n\nKhanom chin sao nam is a kind of noodle salad using fresh Thai rice noodles called khanom chin, mixed in with thick coconut milk, chopped pineapple, garlic, bird's-eye chillies, ginger \"au julienne\", lime juice, fish sauce, and pounded dried shrimp.\nMu kham wan or mu manao is a salad-like dish of sliced grilled pork over which a spicy and very sweet dressing made with lime juice, garlic, bird's-eye chillies, sugar and fish sauce is poured. This dressing is a generic Thai nam chim (lit. \"dipping sauce\"). It is often served sprinkled with mint leaves and served together with thinly sliced raw Chinese broccoli, which are made extra crispy by serving the sliced vegetable on a bed of ice.\nSa are salad-like dishes from northern Thailand which can use a similar chilli and spice paste as the northern Thai lap, but with sliced raw shallots and garlic added into the dish. Two of the numerous variations are sa phli, which is made with uncooked sliced banana flowers, and sa chin, with sliced raw buffalo meat. Sa taengkwa, made with cucumber, doesn't use the lap spice mix but instead a mix of shrimp paste, roasted, fermented soybean, and boiled fermented fish.\nAchat is the Thai version of the Malay and Indonesian pickle called acar. Where the original acar can be made with a whole range of vegetables, the Thai versions are limited to cucumber. Achat is often served in a small dish as a dipping sauce for sate, thot man pla (spicy Thai fish cakes), and popia thot (deep-fried spring rolls). Taengkwa priao wan is a similar salad-like cucumber pickle.\nSup no mai (lit. \"bamboo-shoot salad\") is a salad made by first boiling bamboo shoots, ya nang leaf juice and other ingredients together, after which the resulting salad is mixed with fresh herbs, sliced onions, and dried chillies.\nKhao yam pak tai (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e22\u0e33\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e43\u0e15\u0e49, lit. \"southern Thai mixed rice\") is one of the staples of southern Thailand. It comes in many versions but the basic recipe for the most widespread variation involves mixing cold cooked rice with pieces or slices of unripe mango or pomelo, dried shrimp, budu sauce, bean sprouts, toasted coconut flakes, sliced lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. Sometimes lime juice is added for additional tartness.\nMiang kham are small \"salad\" parcels made with the fresh peppery leaf of the chaphlu wrapped around a filling of toasted coconut, chopped lime, bird's-eye chillies, shallots, and ginger, which has been topped with a sweet and savoury sauce made from palm sugar and fish sauce. Variations include additional ingredients for the filling, such as dried shrimp, roasted peanuts, fried fish or meat, sliced lemongrass, and alternative ingredients for the sauce, such as tamarind, shrimp paste and galangal. These bite-sized parcels are often eaten as a snack or appetiser.\nNam tok mu is made with grilled pork, chilli powder, chopped shallots, ground roasted rice and lime juice.Although not a salad as it doesn't involve mixing ingredients into a specific dish, the Thai tradition of serving a selection of fresh and boiled greens (often vegetables but also raw tree leaves, steamed mushrooms, or cooked pumpkin) together with a saucer or bowl of nam phrik (Thai chilli paste), fits one of the typical characteristics of a salad, being cold vegetables with a \"sauce\" as an accompaniment to a meal.\n\nSee also\nList of Thai dishes\nList of Thai ingredients\nList of salads\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Salads of Thailand at Wikimedia Commons", "summary": "Salads that are internationally known as Thai salads with a few exceptions fall into four main preparation methods.

The recipe was published by General Foods (since merged into what is now Kraft Heinz) and called for two General Foods products: Jell-O instant pistachio pudding and Cool Whip whipped topping, a whipped-cream substitute. According to Kraft, \"There are several urban myths regarding the name change, but we can't substantiate any of them.\" Several competing explanations exist.\nKraft Corporate Affairs said: \"We developed the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight. It was in 1975, the same year that pistachio pudding mix came out.\" Kraft, however, did not refer to it as Watergate Salad until consumers started requesting the recipe for it under the name. \"According to Kraft Kitchens, when the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight was sent out, an unnamed Chicago food editor renamed it Watergate Salad to promote interest in the recipe when she printed it in her column.\" Neither the article nor editor has been tracked down, however.\nThe Denver Post, in the Empire Magazine of June 27, 1976, published a recipe for Watergate Salad. It is sometimes said that Watergate salad was invented by a sous chef at the Watergate Hotel, and it was then served at brunch on most weekends. Watergate Salad took off in popularity during and after the presidential scandal which shares the same name. However, the Denver Post article does not verify this rumor, noting like most sources that the origins of the name are obscure.Syndicated household advice columnists Anne Adams and Nan Nash-Cummings, in their \"Anne & Nan\" column of October 9, 1997, reported that name came from the similar \"Watergate Cake\" (which shares most of the same ingredients): \"The recipes came out during the Watergate scandal. The cake has a 'cover-up' icing and is full of nuts. The salad is also full of nuts.\" Both cake and salad were part of a trend for satirically-named recipes such as Nixon's Perfectly Clear Consomme and Liddy's Clam-Up Chowder.In 1922 Helen Keller published a similar recipe, calling for canned diced pineapple, nuts, marshmallows, whipped cream and other ingredients. \"I ate it first in California, so I call it Golden Gate Salad\". Similar \"fruit salad\" and \"pineapple salad\" recipes had been published in the 1910s, and \"Golden Gate Salad\" was served in some American hotels.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Watergate salad, also referred to as Pistachio Delight or Shut the Gate salad, or colloquially as Green Goop, Green Goddess salad, Green Fluff, Green Stuff, or Mean Green is a side dish salad or dessert salad made from pistachio pudding, canned pineapple, whipped topping, crushed pecans, and marshmallows.

Cardini lived in San Diego but ran one of his restaurants in Tijuana to attract American customers seeking to circumvent the restrictions of Prohibition. His daughter, Rosa, recounted that her father invented the salad at the Tijuana restaurant when a Fourth of July rush in 1924 depleted the kitchen's supplies. Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of table-side tossing by the chef. Some recountings of the history state that Alex Cardini, Caesar Cardini's brother, made the salad, and that the salad was previously named the \"Aviator Salad\" because it was made for aviators who traveled over during Prohibition. A number of Cardini's staff have also said that they invented the dish.\n\nJulia Child said that she had eaten a Caesar salad at Cardini's restaurant when she was a child in the 1920s. In 1946, the newspaper columnist Dorothy Kilgallen wrote of a Caesar containing anchovies, differing from Cardini's version:\n\nThe big food rage in Hollywood\u2014the Caesar salad\u2014will be introduced to New Yorkers by Gilmore's Steak House. It's an intricate  concoction that takes ages to prepare and contains (zowie!)  lots of garlic, raw or slightly coddled eggs, croutons, romaine,  anchovies, parmeasan [sic] cheese, olive oil, vinegar and plenty of black pepper.\nIn a 1952 interview, Cardini said the salad became well known, in 1937, when Manny Wolf, story editor and Paramount Pictures writer's department head, provided the recipe to Hollywood restaurants.In the 1970s, Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves, which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers; coddled eggs; and garlic infused olive oil. Everyone makes the dressing a little differently and anchovy paste is sometimes added with Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard and garlic to enhance the flavor of the olive oil. Several sources have testified that the original recipe used only Worcestershire sauce without any anchovies, which Cardini considered too bold in flavor.Although the original recipe does not contain anchovies, modern recipes typically include anchovies as a key ingredient, which frequently is emulsified in bottled versions. Bottled Caesar dressings are now produced and marketed by many companies.\nThe trademark brands, \"Cardini's\", \"Caesar Cardini's\" and \"The Original Caesar Dressing\" are all claimed to date to February 1950, although they were only registered decades later, and more than a dozen varieties of bottled Cardini's dressing are available today, with various ingredients.\nAs the salad moved North to the U.S, a key ingredient changed within the recipe. Lemon juice is commonly used, despite the original Caesar salad opting for lime.\n\nCommon ingredients\nCommon ingredients in many recipes:\nromaine or cos lettuce\nolive oil\ncrushed garlic\nsalt\nDijon mustard\nblack pepper\nlemon juice\nWorcestershire sauce\nanchovies\nraw or coddled eggs\ngrated Parmesan cheese\ncroutonsVariations include varying the leaf, adding meat such as grilled chicken or bacon, or omitting ingredients such as anchovies and eggs.Vegan versions can replace anchovies with capers and the eggs with tahini.\n\nHealth concerns\nThere is inherent risk of infection by salmonella bacteria occasionally found in raw egg from cracked or improperly handled eggshells where the protective cuticle is damaged. Updated recipes recommend eggs that are briefly heated to 160 degrees or pasteurized eggs. Some variations of the dressing may use other substitutions for egg.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nJulia Child; Paul Child (1975).

One says that it came about in 1938 at the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant, where it became a signature dish. It is named after the restaurant's owner, Robert Howard Cobb. Stories vary whether the salad was invented by Cobb or by his chef, Paul J. Posti. The legend is that Cobb had not eaten until near midnight, and so he mixed together leftovers he found in the kitchen, along with some bacon cooked by the line cook, and tossed it with their French dressing.Another version of the creation is that Robert Kreis, executive chef at the restaurant, created the salad in 1929 (the year the Brown Derby's Hollywood location opened) and named it in honor of Cobb. The same source confirms that 1937 was the reported date of the version noted above, with Cobb making the salad.Another version suggests that the salad was hastily arranged from leftovers by Cobb for showman and theater owner Sid Grauman.

This dish originated in the Netherlands in the 18th century. Coleslaw prepared with vinaigrette may benefit from the long lifespan granted by pickling.Coleslaw originated from the Dutch term \"koolsla,\" meaning \"cabbage salad,\" and has evolved into various forms globally. The only consistent ingredient in coleslaw is raw cabbage, while other ingredients and dressings vary widely. Some popular variations include adding red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onion, grated cheese, pineapple, or apple, and using salad dressings like mayonnaise or cream. Traditional German Krautsalat consists of finely shredded cabbage marinated with oil and vinegar, while in Israel, red cabbage and mayonnaise are commonly used. In the United States, coleslaw often contains buttermilk, mayonnaise, or substitutes, and carrot, with regional variations incorporating prepared mustard or vinegar instead of dairy and mayonnaise.\n\nHistory\nThe term \"coleslaw\" arose in the 18th century as an anglicisation of the Dutch term \"koolsla\" (\"kool\" in Dutch sounds like \"cole\") meaning \"cabbage salad\". The \"cole\" part of the word ultimately derives from the Latin caulis, meaning cabbage.The 1770 Dutch cookbook The Sensible Cook (Dutch: De Verstandige Kock) contains a recipe attributed to the author's Dutch landlady, who mixed thin strips of cabbage with melted butter, vinegar, and oil. The coleslaw recipe, as it is most commonly prepared, is fairly young, as mayonnaise was invented during the mid-18th century.\nAccording to The Joy of Cooking (1997), raw cabbage is the only entirely consistent ingredient in coleslaw; the type of cabbage, dressing, and added ingredients vary widely. Vinaigrette, mayonnaise, and sour cream-based dressings are all listed; bacon, carrots, bell peppers, pineapple, pickles, onions, and herbs are mentioned explicitly as possible added ingredients.\n\nVariations and similar dishes\nThere are many variations of the recipe, which include the addition of other ingredients such as red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onion, grated cheese, pineapple, or apple, mixed with a salad dressing such as mayonnaise or cream. Various seasonings, such as celery seed, may be added. The cabbage may come in finely minced pieces, shredded strips, or small squares. Other slaw variants include broccoli slaw, which uses shredded raw broccoli instead of cabbage. Cream, sour cream, or buttermilk are also popular additions. Buttermilk coleslaw is most commonly found in the southern United States.\nTraditional German Krautsalat consists of finely shredded cabbage marinated with oil and vinegar. Sometimes onions or apples are added.In Israel, a common coleslaw type consists of red cabbage and mayonnaise. It often includes salt, pepper, and lemon juice. The salad is often served as a topping option at food stands. It is also mass-produced and purchased in stores.Coleslaw with cooked ham and sliced pepper (julienne cut) in Italy is called insalata capricciosa (capricious salad).In Poland, cabbage-based salads resembling coleslaw are commonly served as a side dish with the second course at dinner, next to meat and potatoes. There is no fixed recipe, but typical ingredients include shredded white cabbage (red and Chinese cabbage are also not uncommon), finely chopped onions, shredded carrots, and parsley or dill leaves, with many possible additions. These are seasoned with salt, black pepper and a pinch of sugar and tossed with a dash of oil (typically sunflower or rapeseed) and vinegar, while mayonnaise-based dressings are uncommon. An alternative, usually served with fried fish, is made with sauerkraut, squeezed to eliminate excess salty brine and similarly tossed with carrots, onions, black pepper, sugar and oil. Any simple salad of that kind, i.e. one made with shredded raw vegetables, is known as a sur\u00f3wka (Polish: surowy 'raw'). If cabbage is the base ingredient, it is called a sur\u00f3wka z (kiszonej) kapusty, or a \"(soured) cabbage salad\". The English name \"coleslaw\" is mainly associated with the mayonnaise-dressed cabbage. It is often written as \"coles\u0142aw\" or \"koles\u0142aw\" (pronounced [k\u0254\u02c8l\u025bswaf]), because of the similarity to many names ending with \"-s\u0142aw\" (e.g. Boles\u0142aw).In Russia and Ukraine, a salad of fresh shredded cabbage mixed with carrots, apples, cranberries etc., is traditionally dressed with unrefined sunflower oil. The cabbage can be marinated before with vinegar producing cabbage proven\u00e7al (Russian: \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043b\u044c, tr. kapusta provansal). A similar salad is also made of sauerkraut.In Sweden, a particular type of cabbage salad made with a vinaigrette consisting of vinegar or acetic acid (vinegar essence), vegetable oil, salt, and seasonings is classically served with pizza and known as pizzasallad (pizza salad). Recipe adds carrots and leeks and is called veckosallad (week salad) for its notable durability. The term coleslaw (Swedish: coleslaw, or Swedish: k\u00e5lsallad) is reserved for cabbage salad with carrots and mayonnaise-based dressing and is typically seen as American cuisine.\nIn the United Kingdom, coleslaw often contains carrot and onion in addition to cabbage and is usually made with mayonnaise or salad cream. Some variations include grated cheese such as cheddar, nuts such as walnuts and dried fruits such as sultanas or raisins.\nIn the United States, coleslaw often contains buttermilk, mayonnaise or substitutes, and carrot. However, many regional variations exist, and recipes incorporating prepared mustard or vinegar without the dairy and mayonnaise are also common. Barbecue slaw, also known as red slaw, is made using ketchup and vinegar rather than mayonnaise. It is frequently served alongside North Carolina barbecue, including Lexington style barbecue, where, unlike in the rest of the state, a red slaw is the prevailing variety.\n\nSee also\nSauerkraut\nList of cabbage dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n The dictionary definition of coleslaw at Wiktionary", "summary": "Coleslaw (from the Dutch term koolsla meaning 'cabbage salad'), also known as cole slaw, or simply as slaw, is a side dish consisting primarily of finely shredded raw cabbage with a salad dressing or condiment, commonly either vinaigrette or mayonnaise.

A recipe for Crab Louie exists from this date in Bohemian San Francisco by Clarence E.

Others date it even further back to the Phoenecians.\nThe modern version of pasta salad that uses macaroni noodles dates back to 1914 in an American recipe.\n\nIngredients\nThe ingredients used vary widely by region, restaurant, seasonal availability, and/or preference of the preparer. The salad can be as simple as cold macaroni mixed with mayonnaise (a macaroni salad), or as elaborate as several pastas tossed together with a vinaigrette and a variety of fresh, preserved or cooked ingredients. Additional types of pasta may be used, such as ditalini. These can include vegetables, legumes, cheeses, nuts, herbs, spices, meats, poultry, or seafood.  Broccoli, carrot, baby corn, cucumber, olives, onion, beans, chick peas, peppers, and parmesan or feta cheeses are all popular ingredients in versions typically found at North American salad bars.\n\nOceanic commercial variation\nIn Australian and New Zealand cuisine, pasta salad became increasingly popular during the 1990s when commercial versions became more readily available in supermarket stores. It is made of cooked pasta pieces (usually either shell pasta, elbow-shaped pasta or penne) covered in mayonnaise and accompanied by carrots, capsicum (bell peppers), and sometimes celery.

American potato salad most likely originated from recipes brought to the U.S. by way of German and other European immigrants during the nineteenth century.American-style potato salad is served cold or at room temperature. Ingredients often include mayonnaise or a comparable substitute (such as yogurt or sour cream), herbs, and raw vegetables (such as onion and celery). South German-style potato salad is served warm or at room temperature and is made with a vinaigrette, (rather than a creamy mayonnaise-based dressing), and typically includes bacon. North German potato salad is served cold or at room temperature. It is typically made with mayonnaise, hard-boiled egg and sweet or sour pickles. The American style potato salad is likely to have originated from this version. Asian-style potato salad is similar to American-style potato salad, but has a sweeter and eggier flavor.\n\nAmerican potato salad\nThe earliest known American potato salad recipes date back to the mid-19th century or mid-1800s and are rooted in German cuisine, which was introduced to the United States by European settlers. Early American potato salad was made from cooked potatoes that were typically dressed with oil, vinegar, and herbs.\n\nJapanese potato salad\nA version of potato salad in Japan is known as potesara (or potesala \u30dd\u30c6\u30b5\u30e9), an English loanword portmanteau. It traditionally consists of the primary potato salad ingredients (mashed boiled potatoes, boiled eggs) with vegetables (cucumber, onion, carrot) and ham mixed with a dressing of mayonnaise, rice vinegar, and karashi mustard.\n\nRussian potato salad\nIngredients\nOlivier salad typically includes potatoes, mayonnaise, boiled eggs, boiled carrots and pickled cucumbers (in Polish og\u00f3rki kiszone).

The recipe was published by General Foods (since merged into what is now Kraft Heinz) and called for two General Foods products: Jell-O instant pistachio pudding and Cool Whip whipped topping, a whipped-cream substitute. According to Kraft, \"There are several urban myths regarding the name change, but we can't substantiate any of them.\" Several competing explanations exist.\nKraft Corporate Affairs said: \"We developed the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight. It was in 1975, the same year that pistachio pudding mix came out.\" Kraft, however, did not refer to it as Watergate Salad until consumers started requesting the recipe for it under the name. \"According to Kraft Kitchens, when the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight was sent out, an unnamed Chicago food editor renamed it Watergate Salad to promote interest in the recipe when she printed it in her column.\" Neither the article nor editor has been tracked down, however.\nThe Denver Post, in the Empire Magazine of June 27, 1976, published a recipe for Watergate Salad. It is sometimes said that Watergate salad was invented by a sous chef at the Watergate Hotel, and it was then served at brunch on most weekends. Watergate Salad took off in popularity during and after the presidential scandal which shares the same name. However, the Denver Post article does not verify this rumor, noting like most sources that the origins of the name are obscure.Syndicated household advice columnists Anne Adams and Nan Nash-Cummings, in their \"Anne & Nan\" column of October 9, 1997, reported that name came from the similar \"Watergate Cake\" (which shares most of the same ingredients): \"The recipes came out during the Watergate scandal. The cake has a 'cover-up' icing and is full of nuts. The salad is also full of nuts.\" Both cake and salad were part of a trend for satirically-named recipes such as Nixon's Perfectly Clear Consomme and Liddy's Clam-Up Chowder.In 1922 Helen Keller published a similar recipe, calling for canned diced pineapple, nuts, marshmallows, whipped cream and other ingredients. \"I ate it first in California, so I call it Golden Gate Salad\".

Other common ingredients may include mayonnaise, hard-boiled egg, celery, onion, pepper, pickles (or pickle relish) and a variety of mustards.\n\nDescription\nIn Canada and the United States, \"chicken salad\" refers to either any salad with chicken, or a specific mixed salad consisting primarily of chopped chicken meat and a binder, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing or cream cheese. Like tuna salad and egg salad, it may be served on top of lettuce, tomato, avocado, or some combination of these. It may also be used for sandwiches. Typically it is made with leftover cooked or canned chicken. It may also refer to a garden salad with fried, grilled, or roasted chicken (usually cut up or diced) on top.\nIn Europe and Asia the salad may be complemented by any number of dressings, or no dressing at all, and the salad constituents can vary from traditional leaves and vegetables, to pastas, couscous, noodles or rice.\nEarly American chicken salad recipes can be found in 19th-century Southern cookbooks, including Sarah Rutledge's The Carolina Housewife: Or, House and Home (1847) and Abby Fisher's What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking (1881). Rutledge details a recipe for \"A Salad To Be Eaten With Cold Meat Or Fowl\" that explains how to make a mayonnaise from scratch, before adding it to cold meats (chicken and seafood).\nA SALAD TO BE EATEN WITH COLD MEAT OR FOWL.\nThe yolk of a raw egg, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, (it is better if mixed the day before,) half a tea-spoonful of salt. The mustard and salt to be rubbed together; then add the egg. Pour on very slowly the sweet oil, rubbing hard all the time, till as much is made as is wanted. Then add a table-spoonful of vinegar. When these ingredients are mixed, they should look perfectly smooth. If it curdles, add a little more mustard, or a little vinegar. With shrimps or oysters, a little red pepper rubbed in, is an improvement.\nAbby Fisher similarly describes making a homemade mayonnaise, before adding it to chicken and white celery.One of the first American forms of chicken salad was served by Town Meats in Wakefield, Rhode Island, in 1863. The original owner, Liam Gray, mixed his leftover chicken with mayonnaise, tarragon, and grapes. This became such a popular item that the meat market was converted to a delicatessen.\n\nChicken salad is among the Fourth of July foods listed by The American System of Cookery (1847).\n\nSee also\nChicken Salad Chick \u2212 a fast casual chain restaurant that specializes in chicken salad\nChicken sandwich\nList of chicken dishes\nList of sandwiches\nCoronation chicken\nChinese chicken salad\n Food portal\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Chicken salad is any salad with chicken as a main ingredient.

This dish originated in the Netherlands in the 18th century. Coleslaw prepared with vinaigrette may benefit from the long lifespan granted by pickling.Coleslaw originated from the Dutch term \"koolsla,\" meaning \"cabbage salad,\" and has evolved into various forms globally. The only consistent ingredient in coleslaw is raw cabbage, while other ingredients and dressings vary widely. Some popular variations include adding red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onion, grated cheese, pineapple, or apple, and using salad dressings like mayonnaise or cream. Traditional German Krautsalat consists of finely shredded cabbage marinated with oil and vinegar, while in Israel, red cabbage and mayonnaise are commonly used. In the United States, coleslaw often contains buttermilk, mayonnaise, or substitutes, and carrot, with regional variations incorporating prepared mustard or vinegar instead of dairy and mayonnaise.\n\nHistory\nThe term \"coleslaw\" arose in the 18th century as an anglicisation of the Dutch term \"koolsla\" (\"kool\" in Dutch sounds like \"cole\") meaning \"cabbage salad\". The \"cole\" part of the word ultimately derives from the Latin caulis, meaning cabbage.The 1770 Dutch cookbook The Sensible Cook (Dutch: De Verstandige Kock) contains a recipe attributed to the author's Dutch landlady, who mixed thin strips of cabbage with melted butter, vinegar, and oil. The coleslaw recipe, as it is most commonly prepared, is fairly young, as mayonnaise was invented during the mid-18th century.\nAccording to The Joy of Cooking (1997), raw cabbage is the only entirely consistent ingredient in coleslaw; the type of cabbage, dressing, and added ingredients vary widely. Vinaigrette, mayonnaise, and sour cream-based dressings are all listed; bacon, carrots, bell peppers, pineapple, pickles, onions, and herbs are mentioned explicitly as possible added ingredients.\n\nVariations and similar dishes\nThere are many variations of the recipe, which include the addition of other ingredients such as red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onion, grated cheese, pineapple, or apple, mixed with a salad dressing such as mayonnaise or cream. Various seasonings, such as celery seed, may be added. The cabbage may come in finely minced pieces, shredded strips, or small squares. Other slaw variants include broccoli slaw, which uses shredded raw broccoli instead of cabbage. Cream, sour cream, or buttermilk are also popular additions. Buttermilk coleslaw is most commonly found in the southern United States.\nTraditional German Krautsalat consists of finely shredded cabbage marinated with oil and vinegar. Sometimes onions or apples are added.In Israel, a common coleslaw type consists of red cabbage and mayonnaise. It often includes salt, pepper, and lemon juice. The salad is often served as a topping option at food stands. It is also mass-produced and purchased in stores.Coleslaw with cooked ham and sliced pepper (julienne cut) in Italy is called insalata capricciosa (capricious salad).In Poland, cabbage-based salads resembling coleslaw are commonly served as a side dish with the second course at dinner, next to meat and potatoes. There is no fixed recipe, but typical ingredients include shredded white cabbage (red and Chinese cabbage are also not uncommon), finely chopped onions, shredded carrots, and parsley or dill leaves, with many possible additions. These are seasoned with salt, black pepper and a pinch of sugar and tossed with a dash of oil (typically sunflower or rapeseed) and vinegar, while mayonnaise-based dressings are uncommon. An alternative, usually served with fried fish, is made with sauerkraut, squeezed to eliminate excess salty brine and similarly tossed with carrots, onions, black pepper, sugar and oil. Any simple salad of that kind, i.e. one made with shredded raw vegetables, is known as a sur\u00f3wka (Polish: surowy 'raw'). If cabbage is the base ingredient, it is called a sur\u00f3wka z (kiszonej) kapusty, or a \"(soured) cabbage salad\". The English name \"coleslaw\" is mainly associated with the mayonnaise-dressed cabbage. It is often written as \"coles\u0142aw\" or \"koles\u0142aw\" (pronounced [k\u0254\u02c8l\u025bswaf]), because of the similarity to many names ending with \"-s\u0142aw\" (e.g. Boles\u0142aw).In Russia and Ukraine, a salad of fresh shredded cabbage mixed with carrots, apples, cranberries etc., is traditionally dressed with unrefined sunflower oil. The cabbage can be marinated before with vinegar producing cabbage proven\u00e7al (Russian: \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043b\u044c, tr. kapusta provansal). A similar salad is also made of sauerkraut.In Sweden, a particular type of cabbage salad made with a vinaigrette consisting of vinegar or acetic acid (vinegar essence), vegetable oil, salt, and seasonings is classically served with pizza and known as pizzasallad (pizza salad). Recipe adds carrots and leeks and is called veckosallad (week salad) for its notable durability. The term coleslaw (Swedish: coleslaw, or Swedish: k\u00e5lsallad) is reserved for cabbage salad with carrots and mayonnaise-based dressing and is typically seen as American cuisine.\nIn the United Kingdom, coleslaw often contains carrot and onion in addition to cabbage and is usually made with mayonnaise or salad cream. Some variations include grated cheese such as cheddar, nuts such as walnuts and dried fruits such as sultanas or raisins.\nIn the United States, coleslaw often contains buttermilk, mayonnaise or substitutes, and carrot. However, many regional variations exist, and recipes incorporating prepared mustard or vinegar without the dairy and mayonnaise are also common. Barbecue slaw, also known as red slaw, is made using ketchup and vinegar rather than mayonnaise. It is frequently served alongside North Carolina barbecue, including Lexington style barbecue, where, unlike in the rest of the state, a red slaw is the prevailing variety.\n\nSee also\nSauerkraut\nList of cabbage dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n The dictionary definition of coleslaw at Wiktionary", "summary": "Coleslaw (from the Dutch term koolsla meaning 'cabbage salad'), also known as cole slaw, or simply as slaw, is a side dish consisting primarily of finely shredded raw cabbage with a salad dressing or condiment, commonly either vinaigrette or mayonnaise. This dish originated in the Netherlands in the 18th century. Coleslaw prepared with vinaigrette may benefit from the long lifespan granted by pickling.Coleslaw originated from the Dutch term \"koolsla,\" meaning \"cabbage salad,\" and has evolved into various forms globally. The only consistent ingredient in coleslaw is raw cabbage, while other ingredients and dressings vary widely. Some popular variations include adding red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onion, grated cheese, pineapple, or apple, and using salad dressings like mayonnaise or cream. Traditional German Krautsalat consists of finely shredded cabbage marinated with oil and vinegar, while in Israel, red cabbage and mayonnaise are commonly used. In the United States, coleslaw often contains buttermilk, mayonnaise, or substitutes, and carrot, with regional variations incorporating prepared mustard or vinegar instead of dairy and mayonnaise.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/2015-12-20_Spitzkohlsalat_mit_M%C3%B6hren_anagoria.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Bavarian_Krautsalat_Munich.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/CabbageSalad.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Coleslaw.ogg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Purple_cabbage_coleslaw.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Sound-icon.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"]}, {"pageid": 863957, "title": "Coronation chicken", "text": "Coronation chicken or Poulet Reine Elizabeth is an English dish of chicken in a spiced mayonnaise sauce.

American potato salad most likely originated from recipes brought to the U.S. by way of German and other European immigrants during the nineteenth century.American-style potato salad is served cold or at room temperature. Ingredients often include mayonnaise or a comparable substitute (such as yogurt or sour cream), herbs, and raw vegetables (such as onion and celery). South German-style potato salad is served warm or at room temperature and is made with a vinaigrette, (rather than a creamy mayonnaise-based dressing), and typically includes bacon. North German potato salad is served cold or at room temperature. It is typically made with mayonnaise, hard-boiled egg and sweet or sour pickles. The American style potato salad is likely to have originated from this version. Asian-style potato salad is similar to American-style potato salad, but has a sweeter and eggier flavor.\n\nAmerican potato salad\nThe earliest known American potato salad recipes date back to the mid-19th century or mid-1800s and are rooted in German cuisine, which was introduced to the United States by European settlers. Early American potato salad was made from cooked potatoes that were typically dressed with oil, vinegar, and herbs.\n\nJapanese potato salad\nA version of potato salad in Japan is known as potesara (or potesala \u30dd\u30c6\u30b5\u30e9), an English loanword portmanteau. It traditionally consists of the primary potato salad ingredients (mashed boiled potatoes, boiled eggs) with vegetables (cucumber, onion, carrot) and ham mixed with a dressing of mayonnaise, rice vinegar, and karashi mustard.\n\nRussian potato salad\nIngredients\nOlivier salad typically includes potatoes, mayonnaise, boiled eggs, boiled carrots and pickled cucumbers (in Polish og\u00f3rki kiszone). Sometimes canned corn, peas, boiled parsley root, boiled leek or even apples are added. Chopped parsley is commonly used as a garnish.

It may also refer to one of the many fish called 'cappone' (perhaps a gurnard or red mullet).\n\nPreparation\nThe foundation of a cappon magro is a layer of hard tack biscuits (\"gallette\") rubbed with garlic and soaked in seawater and vinegar. Then a pyramid is built up layer by layer.\nEach layer may consist of one or many vegetables, fishes, or seafoods. All recipes include boiled white fish, a lobster, green beans, celery, carrots, beets, and potatoes.  Some authorities insist that black salsify is essential. Other seafoods and vegetables may also be included. Each ingredient is boiled separately, cut up, and seasoned with oil and vinegar. Each layer is dressed with a sort of cross between salsa verde and mayonnaise; it consists of parsley, garlic, capers, anchovies, the yolks of hard-boiled eggs, and green olives ground together in a mortar with olive oil and vinegar. The pyramid is topped with a lobster capped with its coral.

Cardini lived in San Diego but ran one of his restaurants in Tijuana to attract American customers seeking to circumvent the restrictions of Prohibition. His daughter, Rosa, recounted that her father invented the salad at the Tijuana restaurant when a Fourth of July rush in 1924 depleted the kitchen's supplies. Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of table-side tossing by the chef. Some recountings of the history state that Alex Cardini, Caesar Cardini's brother, made the salad, and that the salad was previously named the \"Aviator Salad\" because it was made for aviators who traveled over during Prohibition. A number of Cardini's staff have also said that they invented the dish.\n\nJulia Child said that she had eaten a Caesar salad at Cardini's restaurant when she was a child in the 1920s. In 1946, the newspaper columnist Dorothy Kilgallen wrote of a Caesar containing anchovies, differing from Cardini's version:\n\nThe big food rage in Hollywood\u2014the Caesar salad\u2014will be introduced to New Yorkers by Gilmore's Steak House. It's an intricate  concoction that takes ages to prepare and contains (zowie!)  lots of garlic, raw or slightly coddled eggs, croutons, romaine,  anchovies, parmeasan [sic] cheese, olive oil, vinegar and plenty of black pepper.\nIn a 1952 interview, Cardini said the salad became well known, in 1937, when Manny Wolf, story editor and Paramount Pictures writer's department head, provided the recipe to Hollywood restaurants.In the 1970s, Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves, which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers; coddled eggs; and garlic infused olive oil. Everyone makes the dressing a little differently and anchovy paste is sometimes added with Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard and garlic to enhance the flavor of the olive oil. Several sources have testified that the original recipe used only Worcestershire sauce without any anchovies, which Cardini considered too bold in flavor.Although the original recipe does not contain anchovies, modern recipes typically include anchovies as a key ingredient, which frequently is emulsified in bottled versions. Bottled Caesar dressings are now produced and marketed by many companies.\nThe trademark brands, \"Cardini's\", \"Caesar Cardini's\" and \"The Original Caesar Dressing\" are all claimed to date to February 1950, although they were only registered decades later, and more than a dozen varieties of bottled Cardini's dressing are available today, with various ingredients.\nAs the salad moved North to the U.S, a key ingredient changed within the recipe. Lemon juice is commonly used, despite the original Caesar salad opting for lime.\n\nCommon ingredients\nCommon ingredients in many recipes:\nromaine or cos lettuce\nolive oil\ncrushed garlic\nsalt\nDijon mustard\nblack pepper\nlemon juice\nWorcestershire sauce\nanchovies\nraw or coddled eggs\ngrated Parmesan cheese\ncroutonsVariations include varying the leaf, adding meat such as grilled chicken or bacon, or omitting ingredients such as anchovies and eggs.Vegan versions can replace anchovies with capers and the eggs with tahini.\n\nHealth concerns\nThere is inherent risk of infection by salmonella bacteria occasionally found in raw egg from cracked or improperly handled eggshells where the protective cuticle is damaged. Updated recipes recommend eggs that are briefly heated to 160 degrees or pasteurized eggs. Some variations of the dressing may use other substitutions for egg.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nJulia Child; Paul Child (1975).

While the sisters, Bonifacio, and Annibale stayed in Italy, the other three brothers emigrated to America; Nereo opened a small hotel near the casino in Santa Cruz, California; Alessandro and Gaudenzio eventually were in the restaurant business in Mexico City. Alessandro, called Alex in the US, is reported to have been Caesar's partner in Tijuana, Mexico. Cesare sailed as a steerage passenger on board the RMS Olympic which arrived at the Port of New York on May 1, 1913. After inspection at Ellis Island, he boarded a train bound for Montreal.\nCesare eventually returned to Italy but returned to the United States in 1919. With his partner William Brown, he ran Brown's Restaurant in Sacramento, then moved to San Diego. At that time, he established the first of several restaurants in Tijuana, where he could avoid the restrictions of Prohibition. He married the musician Camille D. Stump on August 27, 1924 in Santa Ana, California. The couple had one daughter, Rosa Maria Cardini (1928\u20132003).Cardini is credited with creating Caesar salad in 1924; it soon became fashionable among Hollywood and other celebrities, especially after he had moved his restaurant a few blocks to the hotel, which was built around 1929 (nowadays called Hotel Caesar's).\nAfter the repeal of the Volstead Act and the Mexican government's enactment of a ban on gambling, business from tourism to Tijuana drastically fell off. Cardini quit his Mexican businesses in 1936 and moved back to San Diego to establish the Caesar Cardini Cafe.  For several years, he operated Tavern Hacienda in San Diego, the Beacon Inn in Cardiff-by-the-Sea and his own Caesar Cardini Villa in  Chula Vista.\nThe family moved to Los Angeles about 1938 and Cardini focused on the production and marketing of his salad dressing which he trademarked in 1948. He died in Good Samaritan Hospital on November 3, 1956, in Los Angeles following a stroke at his home at 8738 Bonner Drive and was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery. His daughter took control of Caesar Cardini Foods Inc. Later, the Cardini's brand was sold, and is now owned by the T. Marzetti specialty salad dressing company. It is still popular and offers more than a dozen varieties of the original recipe.\n\nLegacy\nIn Tijuana, Caesar's Restaurant and Bar on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n, now under Baja Med celebrity chef Javier Plascencia, serves the \"original Caesar's salad\".\n\nSee also\nCarmen Ram\u00edrez Degollado\nZarela Martinez\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Cesare Cardini (also known as Caesar Cardini, February 24, 1896 \u2013 November 3, 1956) was an Italian restaurateur, chef, and hotel owner who, along with his brother Alex Cardini (November 23, 1899 \u2013 December 22, 1974), is credited with creating Caesar salad at his Tijuana restaurant, Caesar's.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/HotelCaesar.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Caesar_Cardini_%28Cesare_Cardini%29_1896-1956.jpg"]}, {"pageid": 23421937, "title": "Dressed herring", "text": "Dressed herring, colloquially known as herring under a fur coat (Russian: \"\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0448\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439\", tr. \"sel'd pod shuboy\" or \"\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0451\u0434\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0448\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439\", \"selyodka pod shuboy\"), is a layered salad composed of diced pickled herring covered with layers of grated boiled eggs, vegetables (potatoes, carrots, beetroots), chopped onions, and mayonnaise.

It is traditionally made of tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, Ni\u00e7oise olives and anchovies or tuna, dressed with olive oil, or in some historical versions, a vinaigrette. It has been popular worldwide since the early 20th century, and has been prepared and discussed by many chefs. Delia Smith called it \"one of the best combinations of salad ingredients ever invented\" and Gordon Ramsay said that \"it must be the finest summer salad of all\".Salade ni\u00e7oise can be served either as a composed salad or as a tossed salad. Freshly cooked or canned tuna may be added. For decades, traditionalists and innovators have disagreed over which ingredients should be included; traditionalists exclude cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade ni\u00e7oise that are popular around the world.\n\nTraditional recipe and its defenders\nThe version known in Nice in the late 19th century was a basic combination of tomatoes,  anchovies and olive oil, described as \"simple food for poor people\". Over time,  other fresh and mostly raw ingredients were added to the salad as served in Nice. A 1903 recipe by Henri Heyraud in a book called La Cuisine \u00e0 Nice included tomatoes, anchovies, artichokes, olive oil, red peppers and black olives, but excluded tuna and lettuce. The dressing included olive oil,  vinegar,  mustard and fines herbes.Former Nice mayor and cookbook author Jacques M\u00e9decin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen called for the salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: \"never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade ni\u00e7oise.\" M\u00e9decin wrote that the salad should be made \"predominantly of tomatoes\" which should be \"salted three times and moistened with olive oil\". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna,  but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, M\u00e9decin believed that salade ni\u00e7oise \"was a product of the sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi.\" M\u00e9decin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad,  commenting, \"As the various ingredients that go into salade ni\u00e7oise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl.\"An organization called Cercle de la Capelina d\u2019Or, led for many years by Ren\u00e9e Graglia until her death in 2013, continues to protest against deviation from traditional local recipes. The group, which certifies restaurants in Nice, sticks with  M\u00e9decin's standards. They reject commonly included ingredients such as green beans and potatoes, as well as innovations such as including sweet corn, mayonnaise, shallots and lemon.In 2016, French Michelin-starred chef H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze posted a salade ni\u00e7oise recipe on Facebook that included cooked potatoes and green beans. According to journalist Mathilde Fr\u00e9nois, the reaction on Facebook was quick and hostile from the \"purists\". Darroze's version was called \"a massacre of the recipe\", a \"sacrilege\", and a violation of the \"ancestral traditions\" of the salad. She was warned that it is \"dangerous to innovate\".\n\nVariations\nThe question of the proper ingredients appropriate for a salade ni\u00e7oise has long been the subject of debate and even controversy. The British cook Nigella Lawson observed \"Everyone seems to have a very strong opinion as to what should or should not go into a Salade Ni\u00e7oise\". Chef and cookbook author Auguste Escoffier (1846\u20131935), born in Villeneuve-Loubet near Nice, added potatoes and green beans, an innovation that remains controversial as a \"questionable idea\" a century later.Salade ni\u00e7oise has been known in the United States since at least the 1920s, when a cookbook for hotel chefs included two variations. The first was vegetarian,  was dressed with mayonnaise, and included lettuce, tomatoes,  potatoes, stringless beans and pimento-stuffed olives, while the second version was a composed salad,  including the same ingredients, plus anchovies.The dish was included in the 1936 cookbook L'Art culinaire moderne by Henri-Paul Pellaprat, which was first translated for American cooks in 1966 as Modern French Culinary Art. His version included cold cooked potatoes and cold cooked green beans.A 1941 U.S. version by chef Louis Diat of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel included the anchovies, was dressed with vinaigrette, and added capers.The highly influential 1961 American cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, included a recipe that incorporated a potato salad, green beans, both tuna and anchovies and a vinaigrette dressing. Co-author Julia Child later demonstrated the recipe on her television show, The French Chef, in 1970.A recipe was included in Prosper Montagn\u00e9's Larousse Gastronomique in 1938. It called for \"equal parts diced potatoes and French beans. Season with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix with anchovy fillets, olives and capers. Garnish with quartered tomatoes.\"French chef Paul Bocuse included a vegetarian version of the salad, garnished with chopped onion and chervil, in the 1977 English translation of his cookbook.A 1979 variation by Pierre Franey is called Salade Ni\u00e7oise aux Poires d'Avocat.  Franey wrote,  \"I am convinced that had avocados been native to Provence they would have been an inevitable ingredient in the celebrated salad of that region, the salad ni\u00e7oise.\" This version also included mushrooms and both black and green olives.Claudia Roden is an advocate of innovation, and observed in 1984 that \"There are not one or two or three versions of salade Nicoise \u2014 but dozens, depending on what is available.\"In 1984, James Beard created a version incorporating rice for an Uncle Ben's advertising campaign.In 1991, Jacques P\u00e9pin wrote an article that called the inclusion of canned tuna the \"conventional choice\", and recommended sauteed fresh tuna instead as \"more elegant\". Mimi Sheraton disagrees, commenting, \"Salade Nicoise with fresh tuna is a travesty . . . if you like it,  you are wrong!\" In 1999, P\u00e9pin joined with Julia Child in a TV series,  Julia and Jacques: Cooking at Home. Each prepared a salad they called \"Near Nicoise\". Child's version was a composed salad including tuna and anchovies canned in olive oil,  and blanched green beans.  P\u00e9pin's was a tossed salad including sauteed fresh tuna and potatoes. \nMany chefs have developed variations using seafood other than anchovies or tuna. Ina Garten, Jamie Oliver and Rachael Ray have published variations using salmon as the fish component. Bobby Flay has published variations incorporating shrimp and swordfish both of which he describes as \"Nicoise\" in quotation marks. Sara Moulton also has a recipe incorporating shrimp. Instead of a conventional salad dressing,  she uses an Italian tuna sauce. A wide variety of seafoods can be used in non-traditional variations, with San Francisco chef Jay Harlow commenting,  \"Mackerel, and even milder fish like rockfish, cod or halibut are also delicious served this way, as are good canned sardines.\"Nigella Lawson has published a quick recipe that substitutes croutons for potatoes.Cat Cora has published a variation that presents the salad as a lettuce wrap.Emeril Lagasse has a recipe that uses a mayonnaise based creamy Parmesan dressing,  and incorporates grilled Yellowfin tuna loin along with Picholine olives in addition to the traditional black olives.Guy Fieri has a recipe that incorporates couscous and mushrooms.Sandra Lee has a version that includes tuna steaks stuffed with olive tapenade.Mark Bittman has a variation that incorporates farro.\n\nNotable chefs\nMany other chefs and food writers have written recipes for the salad.  Among them are Daniel Boulud, Anthony Bourdain, Melissa d'Arabian, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze, Tyler Florence, Simon Hopkinson, Robert Irvine, Gordon Ramsay, Nigel Slater, Delia Smith, Martha Stewart, Michael Symon and Alice Waters.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\nList of tuna dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Ni\u00e7oise salad at the Wikibooks Cookbook subproject\n Media related to Ni\u00e7oise salads at Wikimedia Commons", "summary": "Salade ni\u00e7oise (French pronunciation: \u200b[sa\u02c8lad ni\u02c8swaz]), salada nissarda in the Ni\u00e7ard dialect of the Occitan language, insalata nizzarda in Italian, is a salad that originated in the French city of Nice.

Traditional forms are aku (skipjack tuna) and he\u02bbe (octopus). He\u02bbe poke is sometimes called  tako poke in places where the Hawaiian language is not spoken. Poke differs from other raw fish dishes in that it does not use citrus fruits as a curing agent.\n\nHistory\nPoke began with fishermen seasoning the cut-offs from their catch to serve as a snack. According to the food historian Rachel Laudan, the present form of poke became popular around the 1970s. It used skinned, deboned, and filleted raw fish served with Hawaiian salt, seaweed, and roasted, ground candlenut meat. This form of poke is still common in the Hawaiian islands.Beginning around 2012, poke became increasingly popular in North America. From 2014 to mid-2016, \"the number of Hawaiian restaurants on Foursquare, which includes those that serve poke,\" doubled, going from 342 to 700. These restaurants serve both traditional and modern versions of the dish. The modern version is sometimes called pok\u00e9 bowl and may have the ingredients arranged in a grouped way rather than mixed. Contemporary poke restaurants are mostly\u2014but not exclusively\u2014fast casual style restaurants where the dish is fully customizable from the base to the marinade on the fish. \nThere is a three-day \"I Love Poke\" festival held in San Diego yearly to celebrate the dish and its many variations.\n\nIngredients\nThe traditional Hawaiian poke consists of fish that has been gutted, skinned, and deboned. \nTraditional Hawaiian poke may consist of cubed raw fish, maui onions, inamona (roasted, crushed and salted candlenut), green onions, and/or sesame oil.  It is served with traditional condiments such as Hawaiian sea salt and limu.Modern Hawaiian versions of traditional poke seasonings have been heavily influenced by Japanese and other Asian cuisines, such as soy sauce, furikake (mix of dried fish, sesame seeds, and dried seaweed), chopped dried or fresh chili pepper, fish eggs, and wasabi. Fish types may include cured he\u02bbe (octopus), other types of raw tuna, raw salmon and various kinds of shellfish.North American variations may include ponzu sauce, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce,  sriracha sauce, and mayonnaise as sauces, and avocado, mushrooms, crispy onions, pickled jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, pineapple, cucumber, edamame, green onions, and a variety of other fusion cuisine vegetables among the chopped ingredients. Unlike traditional Hawaiian poke, the mainland style is typically not pre-marinated but is instead prepared with sauces on demand. A variety of fish may be available, with ahi tuna the most popular, and yellowtail, salmon, octopus, crab, and imitation crab as common additional choices.  An option to add a base of cooked rice is not uncommon.\n\nSimilar dishes\nPoke is similar to other Polynesian fish salads such as ika mata in the Cook Islands, kokoda in Fiji, oka in Samoa and \u02bbota \u02bbika in Tonga.A very similar dish is kinilaw, a dish indigenous to the Philippines. Kinilaw is usually raw diced fish marinated in citrus juice, sour fruits, or vinegar with extracts from mangrove bark or fruits (and sometimes coconut milk). This process can also be applied to other seafood and lightly blanched or grilled meat (the latter being generally differentiated as kilawin). The dish was introduced to Guam during the Spanish colonial period, resulting in the derivative Chamorro dish of kelaguen.The Ilocano dish poqui poqui of the Philippines also likely derived its name from poke, after the influx of Ilocano sugarcane workers to Hawaii during the American colonization of the Philippines. However, they are very different dishes, with poqui poqui being a scrambled egg dish with grilled eggplants and tomatoes.Raw fish dishes similar to poke that are often served in Europe are fish carpaccio and fish tartare. Also similar to poke are Korean hoe-deopbap, marinated raw tuna served over rice, and Peruvian ceviche. Japanese sashimi also consists of raw seafood; other similar Japanese dishes are zuke don, a donburi dish topped with cured fish (usually tuna or salmon) along with avocado topped with furikake, and kaisendon, a more elaborate version served with additional non-fish toppings.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nTitcomb, Margaret (1972).

It usually consists of strips of raw fish (sometimes salmon), mixed with shredded vegetables and a variety of sauces and condiments, among other ingredients. There is also a vegetarian version of this dish, where the fish is replaced with soy \"fish\", which resembles salmon. Yusheng literally means \"raw fish\" but since \"fish (\u9b5a)\" is commonly conflated with its homophone \"abundance (\u9918)\", Y\u00fash\u0113ng (\u9b5a\u751f) is interpreted as a homophone for Y\u00fash\u0113ng (\u9918\u5347) meaning an increase in abundance. Therefore, yusheng is considered a symbol of abundance, prosperity and vigor.\nThe dish originated from China but modern takes of the dish existed in both Malaysia and Singapore with both countries having competitive claims over who first modified the dish to its modern version.\nToday, the common form of yusheng is the qicai yusheng (\u4e03\u5f69\u9b5a\u751f; \"seven-coloured raw fish salad\") served in local restaurants during the Chinese New Year period. Also referred to as facai yusheng (\u767c\u8ca1\u9b5a\u751f; \"prosperity raw fish salad\") or xinnian yusheng (\u65b0\u5e74\u9b5a\u751f; \"Chinese New Year raw fish salad\"). The recipe generally includes ingredients such as shredded white and green radish and carrots, ginger slices, onion slices, crushed peanuts, pomelo, pepper, essence of chicken, oil, salt, vinegar, sugar and more.\nYusheng during Chinese New Year is a cultural activity for the Chinese population in Malaysia and Singapore and recently become popular although not historically practiced in Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong over the last few decades.\n\nOrigins\nThe Chinese China Cuisine Association mentions the tradition coming from Guangdong, China before the dishes were brought to Southeast Asia by Chinese immigration. However, the statement only mentions the tradition of having raw fish during Chinese New Year, which was served very differently from today's Yusheng.\n\nDispute\nThe dish originated in China but modern takes of the dish existed in both Malaysia and Singapore with both countries having competitive claims over who invented or modified the dish first.\nIn Singapore, the claim was that the dish was modified by 4 chefs, Than Mui Kai (Tham Yu Kai, co-head chef of Lai Wah Restaurant), Lau Yoke Pui (co-head chef of Lai Wah Restaurant), Hooi Kok Wai (founder of Dragon-Phoenix Restaurant) and Sin Leong (founder of Sin Leong Restaurant) in a restaurant kitchen in Singapore. In the 1970s, the Lai Wah Restaurant located at Bendemeer started the modern-day method of serving yusheng with a pre-mixed special sauce comprising plum sauce, rice vinegar, kumquat paste and sesame oil \u2013 instead of customers mixing inconsistently-concocted sauce.In 2012, Chris Hooi, son of Hooi Kok Wai, one of the four chefs, clarified that the four chefs never claimed they invented the dish and their modified dish only took off in Singapore in the 1960s.In Malaysia, Malaysian newspapers claimed that Yusheng was modified from a fish noodles dish originating from Guangdong, China by Lu Zhen Ji (\u9646\u796f\u8bb0), a Chinese restaurant in the city of Seremban, Malaysia.In 2009, the Malaysian Department of National Heritage declared Yusheng, alongside other Malaysian food dishes, as an Intangible Heritage Object of Malaysia.In 2020, a descendant of Lu Zhen Ji stated that the origin of the claim was hard to prove and meaningless to insist on an origin, ending the dispute.\n\nIngredients and their symbolism\nWhen putting the yusheng on the table, New Year greetings are offered. Some of the phrases commonly used are:\n\n\u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1 / \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22 (pinyin: gong xi fa cai; Jyutping: gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4) meaning \"Congratulations and be wealthy\"\n\u842c\u4e8b\u5982\u610f / \u4e07\u4e8b\u5982\u610f (pinyin: wan shi ru yi; Jyutping: maan6 si6 jyu4 ji3) meaning \"May all your wishes be fulfilled\"The fish is added \u2013 its Mandarin word, \"\u9b5a\" (pronounced \"yu\") corresponds to a homophone of it \"\u9918 / \u4f59\" meaning \"abundance\", thus \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918 / \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59 (pinyin: nian nian you yu; Jyutping: nin4 nin4 jau5 jyu4), \"abundance through the year\". Pomelo or lime (\u5927\u5229, da li / daai lei) is added to the fish, adding luck and auspicious value (\u5927\u5409\u5927\u5229 pinyin: da ji da li; Jyutping: daai6 gat1 daai6 lei6, meaning \"good luck and smooth sailing\"). Pepper is then dashed over in the hope of attracting more money and valuables. \u62db\u8ca1\u9032\u5bf6 / \u62db\u8d22\u8fdb\u5b9d pinyin: zhao cai jin bao; Jyutping: ziu1 coi4 zeon3 bou2 meaning \"Attract wealth and treasures\". Then oil is poured out, circling the ingredients and encouraging money to flow in from all directions \u2013 referring to \u4e00\u672c\u842c\u5229 / \u4e00\u672c\u4e07\u5229 pinyin: yi ben wan li; Jyutping: jat1 bun2 maan6 lei6, meaning \"make 10,000 times of profit with your capital\", and \u8ca1\u6e90\u5ee3\u9032 / \u8d22\u6e90\u5e7f\u8fdb pinyin: cai yuan guang jin; Jyutping: coi4 jyun4 gwong2 zeon3 meaning \"numerous sources of wealth\".\nCarrots are added indicating blessings of good luck: the first word in the compound word representing the ingredient, \"\u7d05\u863f\u8514 / \u7ea2\u841d\u535c\" (pinyin: hong luo bo; Jyutping: hung4 lo4 baak6 pong6), \u7d05 / \u7ea2 (hong / hung) has a homophone in \u9d3b / \u9e3f referring to \u9d3b\u904b\u7576\u982d / \u9e3f\u8fd0\u5f53\u5934 pinyin: hong yun dang tou; Jyutping: hung4 wan6 dong1 tau4 meaning \"good luck is approaching\". Shredded green radish is later added symbolising eternal youth \u2013 \u9752\u6625\u5e38\u99d0 / \u9752\u6625\u5e38\u9a7b pinyin: qing chun chang zhu; Jyutping: cing1 ceon1 soeng4 zyu3, \"forever young\". After which the shredded white radish is added \u2013 prosperity in business and promotion at work (\u98a8\u751f\u6c34\u8d77 / \u98ce\u751f\u6c34\u8d77 pinyin: feng sheng shui qi; Jyutping: fung1 saang1 seoi2 hei2 \u2013 \"progress at a fast pace\", \u6b65\u6b65\u9ad8\u5347 pinyin: bu bu gao sheng; Jyutping: bou6 bou6 gou1 sing1 \u2013 \"reaching higher level with each step\").\nThe condiments are finally added. First, peanut crumbs are dusted on the dish, symbolising a household filled with gold and silver (\u91d1\u9280\u6eff\u5c4b / \u91d1\u94f6\u6ee1\u5c4b pinyin: jin yin man wu; Jyutping: gam1 ngan4 mun5 uk1, meaning \"household filled with gold and silver\"). Sesame seeds quickly follow symbolizing a flourishing business (\u751f\u610f\u8208\u9686 / \u751f\u610f\u5174\u9686 pinyin: sheng yi xing long; Jyutping: saang1 ji3 hing1 lung4, meaning \"prosperity for the business\") Yu Sheng sauce, usually made from plum sauce, is generously drizzled over everything \u2013 a reference to \u751c\u751c\u871c\u871c pinyin: tian tian mi mi; Jyutping: tim4 tim4 mat6 mat6, meaning \"may life always be sweet\" Deep-fried flour crisps in the shape of golden pillows is then added with wishes that literally the whole floor would be filled with gold (\u904d\u5730\u9ec3\u91d1 / \u904d\u5730\u9ec4\u91d1 pinyin: bian di huang jin; Jyutping: pin3 dei6 wong4 gam1, \"floor full of gold\").\n\nModern version of the dish\nThe yusheng had fish served with daikon (white radish), carrots, red pepper (capsicum), turnips, red pickled ginger, sun-dried oranges, key lime leaves, coriander, chilli, jellyfish, chopped peanuts, toasted sesame seeds, Chinese shrimp crackers (or fried dried shrimp), five spice powder and other ingredients, laced with a sauce using plum sauce, rice vinegar, kumquat paste and sesame oil, for a total of 27 ingredients. Originally, the dish used raw wolf herring, although  salmon was later offered as an alternative due to said species' growing popularity with customers.\n\nServing\nYusheng is often served as part of a multi-dish dinner, usually as the appetizer due to its symbolism of \"good luck\" for the new year. Some would consume it on Renri, the seventh day of the Chinese New Year, although in practice it may be eaten on any convenient day during the Chinese New Year period (the first to the 15th day of the first lunar month).\nThe base ingredients are first served. The leader amongst the diners or the restaurant server proceeds to add ingredients such as the fish, the crackers and the sauces while saying \"auspicious wishes\" (\u5409\u7965\u8a71 / \u5409\u7965\u8bdd pinyin: j\u00edxi\u00e1ng hu\u00e0; Jyutping: gat1 coeng4 waa6*2) as each ingredient is added, typically related to the specific ingredient being added. For example, phrases such as  \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918 / \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59 (pinyin: ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u014fuy\u00fa; Jyutping: nin4 nin4 jau5 jyu4; \"may there be abundance year after year\") are uttered as the fish is added, as the Chinese word for \"surplus\" or \"abundance\" (\u9918 / \u4f59 pinyin: y\u00fa; Jyutping: jyu4) sounds the same as the Chinese word for \"fish\" (\u9b5a / \u9c7c pinyin: y\u00fa; Jyutping: jyu4).\nAll diners at the table then stand up and proceed to toss the shredded ingredients into the air with chopsticks while saying various \"auspicious wishes\" out loud, or simply \"lo hei, lo hei\" (\u6488\u8d77, pinyin: l\u0101oq\u01d0, l\u0101oq\u01d0 meaning \"scoop it up, scoop it up\"). It is believed that the height of the toss reflects the height of the diners' growth in fortunes, thus diners are expected to toss enthusiastically.\n\nSee also\nCeviche\nHoe (dish)\nKuai (dish)\nList of salads\nNamasu\nSashimi\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nInteractive Virtual Reality \u2013 Process of Lo Hei\nJack Tsen-Ta Lee, A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English \u2013 lo hei\nJack Tsen-Ta Lee, A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English \u2013 yusheng\nA recipe for yusheng\nDIY Spring Toss Yusheng recipe\nHow to toss Yee Sang (video)\nYusheng Ingredients Meaning", "summary": "Yusheng, yee sang or yuu sahng (Chinese: \u9b5a\u751f; pinyin: y\u00fash\u0113ng; Jyutping: jyu4saang1), or Prosperity Toss, also known as lo sahng (Cantonese for \u6488\u751f) is a Cantonese-style raw fish salad. It usually consists of strips of raw fish (sometimes salmon), mixed with shredded vegetables and a variety of sauces and condiments, among other ingredients. There is also a vegetarian version of this dish, where the fish is replaced with soy \"fish\", which resembles salmon. Yusheng literally means \"raw fish\" but since \"fish (\u9b5a)\" is commonly conflated with its homophone \"abundance (\u9918)\", Y\u00fash\u0113ng (\u9b5a\u751f) is interpreted as a homophone for Y\u00fash\u0113ng (\u9918\u5347) meaning an increase in abundance. Therefore, yusheng is considered a symbol of abundance, prosperity and vigor.\nThe dish originated from China but modern takes of the dish existed in both Malaysia and Singapore with both countries having competitive claims over who first modified the dish to its modern version.\nToday, the common form of yusheng is the qicai yusheng (\u4e03\u5f69\u9b5a\u751f; \"seven-coloured raw fish salad\") served in local restaurants during the Chinese New Year period. Also referred to as facai yusheng (\u767c\u8ca1\u9b5a\u751f; \"prosperity raw fish salad\") or xinnian yusheng (\u65b0\u5e74\u9b5a\u751f; \"Chinese New Year raw fish salad\"). The recipe generally includes ingredients such as shredded white and green radish and carrots, ginger slices, onion slices, crushed peanuts, pomelo, pepper, essence of chicken, oil, salt, vinegar, sugar and more.\nYusheng during Chinese New Year is a cultural activity for the Chinese population in Malaysia and Singapore and recently become popular although not historically practiced in Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong over the last few decades.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Antennarius_striatus.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Asia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/ChineseDishLogo.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Flag_of_Malaysia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Flag_of_Singapore.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Tossing_yusheng_at_Caf%C3%A9_Mosaic%2C_Carlton_Hotel%2C_Singapore_-_20150225.webm", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Yeesang.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Yu_sheng_sold_at_supermarkets_in_Singapore.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Yusheng_%28_in_Shunde%2C_Guangdong%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"]}, {"pageid": 1310911, "title": "Fruit salad", "text": "Fruit salad is a dish consisting of various kinds of fruit, sometimes served in a liquid, either their juices or a syrup. In different forms, fruit salad can be served as an appetizer or a side salad.  When served as an appetizer, a fruit salad is sometimes known as a fruit cocktail (often connoting a canned product), or fruit cup (when served in a small container).\nThere are many types of fruit salad, ranging from the basic (no nuts, marshmallows, or dressing) to the moderately sweet (Waldorf salad) to the sweet (ambrosia salad). Another \"salad\" containing fruit is a jello salad, with its many variations. A fruit cocktail is well-defined in the US to mean a well-distributed mixture of small diced pieces of (from highest percentage to lowest) peaches, pears, pineapple, grapes, and cherry halves. Fruit salad may also be canned (with larger pieces of fruit than a cocktail).\n\nDescription\nThere are several home recipes for fruit salads that contains different kinds of fruit, or that use a different kind of sauce other than the fruit's juice or syrup.  Common ingredients used in fruit salads include strawberries, pineapple, honeydew, watermelon, grapes, and kiwifruit. Various recipes may call for the addition of nuts, fruit juices, certain vegetables, yogurt, or other ingredients.\nOne variation is a Waldorf-style fruit salad, which uses a mayonnaise-based sauce. Other recipes use sour cream (such as in ambrosia), yogurt, or even custard as the primary sauce ingredient. A variation on fruit salad uses whipped cream mixed in with many varieties of fruits (usually a mixture of berries), and also often includes miniature marshmallows. Rojak, a Malaysian fruit salad, uses a spicy sauce with peanuts and shrimp paste. In the Philippines, fruit salads are popular party and holiday fare, usually made with buko, or young coconut, and condensed milk in addition to other canned or fresh fruit. Sicilian orange salad is a typical dish of Sicily (Italy) and Spain in which orange slices are dressed with olive oil, salt, and black pepper.\nMexico has a popular variation of the fruit salad called Bionico which consists of various fruits drenched in condensed milk and sour cream mix.  Guacamole may also be considered a fruit salad, consisting predominantly of various fruits and fruit juices such as avocados, lemon and/or lime juice, tomatoes, chili peppers, and black peppercorns.\nThere is also an extended variety of fruit salads in Moroccan cuisine, often as part of a kemia, a selection of appetizers or small dishes analogous to Spanish tapas or eastern Mediterranean mezze.\nA fruit salad ice cream is also commonly manufactured, with small pieces of real fruit embedded, flavored either with juices from concentrate, fruit extracts, or artificial chemicals.\n\nFruit cocktail\nFruit cocktail is often sold canned and is a staple of cafeterias, but can also be made fresh. The use of the word \"cocktail\" in the name does not mean that it contains alcohol, but refers to the secondary definition: \" an appetizer made by combining pieces of food, such as fruit or seafood\". \nIn the United States, the USDA stipulates that canned \"fruit cocktail\" must contain a certain percentage distribution of pears, grapes, cherries, peaches, and pineapples to be marketed as fruit cocktail. It must contain fruits in the following range of percentages:\n30% to 50% diced peaches, any yellow variety\n25% to 45% diced pears, any variety\n6% to 16% diced pineapple, any variety\n6% to 20% whole grapes, any seedless variety\n2% to 6% cherry halves, any light sweet or artificially colored red variety (like maraschino cherries)Both William Vere Cruess of the University of California, Berkeley and Herbert Gray of the Barron-Gray Packing Company of San Jose, California have been credited with the invention of fruit cocktails. Barron\u2013Gray was the first company to sell fruit cocktail commercially, beginning in 1930, and California Packing Corporation began selling it under its Del Monte brand a few years later.Canned fruit cocktails and canned fruit salad are similar, but fruit salad contains larger fruit while fruit cocktail is diced.  Commercially, the fruit used was healthy but cosmetically damaged, such as a peach or pear that was bruised on one side.  The bruised parts would be cut away and discarded, and the rest would be diced into small pieces.\n\nIn popular culture\n\"Fruit Salad\" (also known as \"Fruit Salad Yummy Yummy\") is the name of a song by Australian children's band the Wiggles.\n\"Fruit-salad\" is also a slang term used for medals on a soldier's uniform, e.g. \"Look at the fruit-salad on that colonel.\" The term refers to the bright colors of a high percentage of the ribbons that usually go with medals.\"Fruit salad\" is an alternative name for the party game Fruit Basket Turnover.\n\nSee also\nMacedonia (food), a variation made of small pieces of fruit or vegetable\nCompote, dessert of fruit in syrup\nGreen papaya salad, a savory salad made from the unripe fruit\nCleric\u00f3 \u2013 a Latin American version of sangria, made from mixed fruit and wine\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHistory of fruit salad", "summary": "Fruit salad is a dish consisting of various kinds of fruit, sometimes served in a liquid, either their juices or a syrup.

According to the Talmud its color and texture are meant to recall mortar (or mud used to make adobe bricks) which the Israelites used when they were enslaved in Ancient Egypt as mentioned in Tractate Pesahim (page 116a) of the Talmud.

After reciting the blessings, and eating first maror dipped in charoset and then a matzah \"Hillel sandwich\" (with two matzot) combining charoset and maror, people often eat the remainder spread on matzah.\n\nHistory\nCharoset is mentioned in the Mishna in connection with the items placed on the Passover table: \"unleavened bread and lettuce and charoset.\" Some say it can be traced back to the custom of symposia in ancient Greece, where philosophical discussions were accompanied by drinking large quantities of wine and consuming foods dipped into mixtures of pounded nuts and spices.\n\nVariations\nThere are many recipes for charoset. Many include at least some of the fruits and spices mentioned in the Song of Songs: apples 2-3, figs 2-13, pomegranates 4-3, grapes 2-15, walnuts 6-11, dates 7-7 with the addition of wine 1-2, saffron 4-14 and cinnamon 4-14. According to Jonathan Brumberg-Kraus \"the influence of Persian culinary preferences on Jews living in the medieval Islamic empires probably reinforced this 'Song of Songs' flavor profile.The spices used vary among cultures; Yemenites use cloves and pepper, while American Jews typically use cinnamon. In Italy, Venetian Jews have been known to add chestnuts and pine nuts. Halek is a variation made by Persian Jews using dates instead of apples. Locally grown blueberries are added to the traditional recipe in Maine.\n\nSephardi traditions\nSephardi charoset is a paste made of raisins, figs and dates. \nEgyptian Jews make it from dates, raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, and sweet wine. \nGreek and Turkish Jews use apples, dates, chopped almonds, and wine. Italian Jews add chestnuts. \nSuriname Jews add coconut.Iraqi Jews make it from a mixture of dates and nuts.\n\nYemenite tradition\nYihye Bashiri (17th century) described the manner in which the charoset was made in Yemen: They take figs or raisins or dates, and pound them into the consistency of dough. They then put vinegar thereto, and add spices.  Some there are who put ground sesame seeds into this admixture. On the night of the Passover, a person is required to put therein whole spices that have not been ground; either two or three seeds of valerian  (Arabic: sunbul), or sprigs of marjoram  [alternatively: wild thyme ] (Arabic: za'tar), or savory  (Arabic: hasha), or things similar to them, so that it will resemble straw in mortar\u2014in remembrance of that thing by which our fathers were enslaved in Egypt, seeing that it is like unto bricks and straw.\nIn Yemenite Jewish tradition, the charoset is also called dukeh (Hebrew: \u05d3\u05d5\u05db\u05d4), a name also referred to as such in the Jerusalem Talmud.\n\nMizrahi traditions\nNot all Jews use the term charoset. Some of the Jews of the Middle East instead use the term \"halegh\".  The origin of halegh is not clear. Rav Saadia Gaon uses the word and attributes it to a kind of walnut that was a mandatory ingredient in the preparation of the halegh.\nParts of the Jewish Diaspora in Iran have a tradition of including 40 different ingredients in the halegh. The number 40 signifies the 40 years of wandering in the desert.\n\nAshkenazi traditions\nEastern European (or Ashkenazi) charoset is made from chopped walnuts and apples, spiced with cinnamon and sweet red wine. Honey or sugar may be added as a sweetener and binder. The mixture is not cooked.\n\nModern variations\nIn 2015 Ben & Jerry's Charoset ice cream became widely available in Israel and was covered in several major news outlets.\n\nLeftovers\nLeftover charoset is commonly eaten with matzah, but it can also be used as a filling for hand pies.

It was created by the Lao people and is a popular national dish of Laos. It also is a popular food in the neighbouring Northeastern region of Thailand and has gained its popularity in the country  and the rest of the continental Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam), as well as Xishuangbanna (China).\n\nHistory\nPapaya and chili peppers were introduced to Southeast Asia by the Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 17th century from the Americas. Simon de la Loub\u00e8re (1642-1729), a French diplomat, mentioned in his book that the cultivation of papaya was already widespread in Siam in 1693.\nAlthough it is unknown when papayas entered Laos specifically, they had already been integrated into Lao culture by the time of Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix's visit in 1836. Papaya, among other fruits, were cultivated in Cambodia by Chinese settlers who immigrated in the 1500s from Hainan, China. The Lao name for papaya is mak hung and was likely derived from l'hun or lohung/rohung as papayas are called by Cambodians and Cambodian indigenous people living in provinces bordering the Southeastern region of Laos. It is believed that green papaya salad, known as tam mak hung or tam som in Lao and as som tam in Thai, likely originated in Laos. \nThai historian Sujit Wongthes has speculated that the green papaya salad originated in the communities of ethnic Chinese\u2013Lao settlers living in what is now Central Thailand, who adopted the ancient Lao tradition of preparing salads from fruits, called tam som, to make salads from papayas. The new dish became known as som tam (the reversed order of tam som) during the early Rattanakosin period (late 18th to early 19th centuries) and, along with the papaya, then spread to today's Northeast Thailand following the construction of the Northeastern railway line during the turn of the 19th\u201320th centuries. The dish became more popular after the opening of Mittraphap Road in 1957, helping bring new papaya cultivars into the region, and has since become widely adopted by the ethnic Lao people of both Isan and Laos. Likewise, the hot flavour also spread to Isan and Laos from Central Thailand, which had been introduced to chilli peppers first.However, chilli peppers, like papayas, were already fully integrated in the Lao territory by the time French explorer Henri Mouhot visited Laos, in 1861, and also in the Lao traditional culinary recipes. Furthermore, during the 1950s and 1960s, green papaya salad and other Lao dishes were rarely known in Bangkok and could only be found around the boxing stadium that gathered boxers and fans from Northeastern Thailand, as well as in mobile food carts outside construction sites with workers from Northeastern Thailand and gas stations serving long-distance bus drivers. Some people believe that som tam, today\u2019s popular green papaya salad in Thailand, derived from the Lao tam som or tam mak hoong tradition that migrant workers from the Northeast had brought with them to Bangkok during the mid-1900s.  During the standardization of the Thai national cuisine, green papaya salad was among the Northeastern or Lao dishes to be included into the Thai national cuisine and modified by reducing the amount of chilli peppers and increasing the amount of sugar.Alternatively, others believe that som tam has evolved from a dish called \"Pu Tam\" (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e39\u0e48\u0e15\u0e33, lit.\u2009'Crab Salad') mentioned in a recipe by gourmet chef Plien Passakornwong in her 1908 cookbook. This dish shares similarities with modern-day som tam but does not include papaya as an ingredient. The earliest known recipe for som tam in Thailand appeared in the Yaowapha cookbook series by Phra Chao Boromawong in 1935, which included \"Som tam ton malakor\" (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e15\u0e33\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e21\u0e30\u0e25\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d) or \"Khao man som tam\" (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e15\u0e33). This recipe is similar to the som tam we know today and includes roasted peanuts and dried shrimp as key ingredients. It is often served with rice cooked in coconut milk.\n\nPreparation\nThe dish combines the five main basic tastes: sourness of the lime, the spiciness of the chili, saltiness and savoriness of the fish sauce, and sweetness of palm sugar. The ingredients are mixed and pounded in a mortar, which is reflected in the Khmer, Lao and Thai names for the dish that literally mean \"pounded papaya\".\nIn Laos, green papaya salad is one of the traditional staples of the Lao. Pounded salads in Laos all fall under the parent category of tam som, which may or may not contain green papaya, however, when no specific type of tam som is mentioned, it is generally understood to refer to green papaya salad. For absolute clarity, however, the name tam maak hoong may be used, since this name means \"pounded papaya\".\nIn Thailand, it is customary that a customer ask the preparer to make the dish suited to his or her tastes. To specifically refer to the original style of papaya salad as prepared in Laos or Isan, it is known as \u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e15\u0e33\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27 or som tam Lao or simply as tam Lao and the dish as prepared in central Thailand may be referred to as som tam Thai.\nTraditionally, the local variety of green papaya salad in the streets of Bangkok is very spicy due to the addition of a fistful of chopped hot bird's eye chili. However, with its rising popularity among tourists, it is now often served less spicy as it used to be in the past.\n\nAdditional ingredients\nTogether with the papaya, some or most of the following secondary items are added and pounded in the mortar with the pestle:\n\nAsparagus beans\nBrined \"rice field crabs\". These belong to the freshwater crab genera Sayamia, Chulathelphusa, and Esanthelphusa (previously classified as part of the genus Somanniathelphusa), which all belong to the Gecarcinucid crab subfamily Parathelphusinae. found in flooded rice fields and canals. Isan people eat the entire crab, including the shell.\nChili pepper\nDried shrimp\nFish sauce\nGarlic\nMonosodium glutamate\nHog plums\nLime slice and lime juice\nPalm sugar\nShrimp paste\nFish paste\nRaw Thai eggplant\nCherry or grape tomatoes (green or ripe)Green papaya salad is often served with glutinous rice and kai yang/ping gai (grilled chicken). It can also be eaten with fresh rice noodles or simply as a snack by itself with, for instance, crispy pork rinds. The dish is often accompanied by raw green vegetables such as water spinach and white cabbage wedges on the side to mitigate the spiciness of the dish.\n\nVariations\nIt is believed to have originated in Laos, from where it was exported into Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. Variations of the dish are found throughout Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and as well as in the West, where it is more commonly known by its Thai name.A non-spicy green papaya salad version also exists in Laos, Vietnam and Thailand, which is much sweeter; it often contains crushed peanuts and is less likely to have fish paste or brined crab. Dried brine shrimp are used in this Central Thai version. There are also versions that make use of unripe mangoes, apples, cucumbers, carrots and other firm vegetables or unripe fruit. Besides using varieties of fruits or vegetables as the main ingredient a popular option is to use vermicelli rice noodles wherein the dish is known as tam sua.Instead of papaya, other ingredients can be used as the main ingredient. Popular variations in Laos and Thailand include the salad with:\nCucumber, usually the small variety (tam maak taeng, tam taengkwa)\nGreen and unripe mango (tam maak muang, tam mamuang)\nGreen and unripe bananas (tam maak kuai, tam kluai)\nHard and unripe santol (tam krathon)\nBanana flowers (tam hua pli)\nMalay gooseberry (tam mayom)\nPomelo (tam som o)\nMu yo sausage (tam mu yo)\nMixed fruit (tam phonlamai ruam)\nCoconut rice (khao man som tam)\n\nReception\nThe Thai variation som tam has been listed at number 46 on World's 50 most delicious foods compiled by CNN Go in 2011 and 2018.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of fruit dishes\nList of salads\nAtchara\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nCummings, Joe.

The Waldorf-Astoria's ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Oscar Tschirky, developed or inspired many of the hotel's signature dishes and is widely credited with creating the salad recipe. In 1896, the salad appeared in The Cook Book by \"Oscar of the Waldorf\".The original recipe was just apples, celery, and mayonnaise. It did not contain nuts, but they had been added by the time the recipe appeared in The Rector Cook Book in 1928.\n\nModern versions\nOther ingredients such as chicken, turkey, and dried fruit (e.g. dates or raisins) are sometimes added. Updated versions of the salad sometimes change the dressing to a seasoned mayonnaise or a yogurt dressing. Modern Waldorf salad may also include the zest of oranges and/or lemons.

The recipe was published by General Foods (since merged into what is now Kraft Heinz) and called for two General Foods products: Jell-O instant pistachio pudding and Cool Whip whipped topping, a whipped-cream substitute. According to Kraft, \"There are several urban myths regarding the name change, but we can't substantiate any of them.\" Several competing explanations exist.\nKraft Corporate Affairs said: \"We developed the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight. It was in 1975, the same year that pistachio pudding mix came out.\" Kraft, however, did not refer to it as Watergate Salad until consumers started requesting the recipe for it under the name. \"According to Kraft Kitchens, when the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight was sent out, an unnamed Chicago food editor renamed it Watergate Salad to promote interest in the recipe when she printed it in her column.\" Neither the article nor editor has been tracked down, however.\nThe Denver Post, in the Empire Magazine of June 27, 1976, published a recipe for Watergate Salad. It is sometimes said that Watergate salad was invented by a sous chef at the Watergate Hotel, and it was then served at brunch on most weekends. Watergate Salad took off in popularity during and after the presidential scandal which shares the same name. However, the Denver Post article does not verify this rumor, noting like most sources that the origins of the name are obscure.Syndicated household advice columnists Anne Adams and Nan Nash-Cummings, in their \"Anne & Nan\" column of October 9, 1997, reported that name came from the similar \"Watergate Cake\" (which shares most of the same ingredients): \"The recipes came out during the Watergate scandal. The cake has a 'cover-up' icing and is full of nuts. The salad is also full of nuts.\" Both cake and salad were part of a trend for satirically-named recipes such as Nixon's Perfectly Clear Consomme and Liddy's Clam-Up Chowder.In 1922 Helen Keller published a similar recipe, calling for canned diced pineapple, nuts, marshmallows, whipped cream and other ingredients. \"I ate it first in California, so I call it Golden Gate Salad\". Similar \"fruit salad\" and \"pineapple salad\" recipes had been published in the 1910s, and \"Golden Gate Salad\" was served in some American hotels.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Watergate salad, also referred to as Pistachio Delight or Shut the Gate salad, or colloquially as Green Goop, Green Goddess salad, Green Fluff, Green Stuff, or Mean Green is a side dish salad or dessert salad made from pistachio pudding, canned pineapple, whipped topping, crushed pecans, and marshmallows.

The vermicelli is used fresh, as it ferments quickly in Myanmar's tropical climate. There are a number of mont di dishes, and the Rakhine mont di of the Arakanese from western Myanmar is the most popular. Mandalay mont di is another well-known dish. A handful of regional rice vermicelli dishes, such as Mawlamyaing mohinga and Kengtung khao sen, are also interchangeably called \"mont di.\"\n\nRegional variations\nAll the variants of mont di are often accompanied by Burmese fritters (\u1021\u1000\u103c\u1031\u102c\u103a), of one's choice.\n\nRakhine mont di\nRakhine mont di (Burmese: \u101b\u1001\u102d\u102f\u1004\u103a\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e) is the most popular dish in association with the Rakhine people. It is a semi-staple dish of the Rakhine State. It comes in two forms: salad or soup.\nThe soup is the more common version, in which rice vermicelli is mixed with a thin soup made of daggertooth pike conger, called thinbaw htoe (\u101e\u1004\u103a\u1039\u1018\u1031\u102c\u1011\u102d\u102f\u1038) in Arakanese, nga shwe (\u1004\u102b\u1038\u101b\u103d\u103e\u1031) in Burmese), Rakhine ngapi and lemongrass. Dry roasted pike conger eel flakes, fried onion and garlic, fresh coriander, red and green chili paste are added. It is also called arpu sharpu (\u1021\u102c\u1015\u1030\u101c\u103b\u103e\u102c\u1015\u1030, lit.\u2009'hot throat, hot tongue'), due to the green chili paste. Some add fried pulverised nga phe and pork rind.\nIn the dry salad form, the same ingredients are mixed into a colourful combination. The green chili paste gives the white rice vermicelli a slight greenish hue.\n\nMandalay mont di\nMandalay mont di (Burmese: \u1019\u1014\u1039\u1010\u101c\u1031\u1038\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e), also called nan gyi thoke (\u1014\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038\u101e\u102f\u1015\u103a), is quite different from Rakhine mont di. It uses meat instead of marine fish, as Mandalay is an inland city located in Central Myanmar. The noodles used are thick round rice noodles called nan gyi. The meat is cooked as a sauce and added to the noodles like a salad (in some recipes only). Many authentic shops uses a variation of chickpea flour and its different flavoured oils to bring about its unique Mandalay flavours. Most mont di shops will prepare the dish based on the customers' preferences for specific tastes and offers the option of \"mixing\" (tossing) it for the customer.\n\nDawei mont di\nDawei mont di (\u1011\u102c\u1038\u101d\u101a\u103a\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e), also known as Dawei mont let thoke (\u1011\u102c\u1038\u101d\u101a\u103a\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101c\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1015\u103a), is a specialty of Dawei in Southern Myanmar. The dish consists of threadfin fish or catfish boiled in fermented toddy palm juice and coconut milk, served with rice vermicelli, and garnished with hand-crushed murukku.\n\nKhotaung mont di\nKhotaung mont di (\u1001\u102d\u102f\u1010\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e) is a well-known Burmese noodle salad originating from the small village of Khotaung in Sagaing Region. The salad uses thick rice noodles (also used in nan gyi thoke) and fish balls, mixed with chopped cabbage, green beans, pickled radish, chickpea flour, garlic oil, with optional toppings, including Burmese fritters, jengkol, and fish cake. The dish is typically accompanied with a light broth made from fish balls and fish head. The origins of the dish date to the Konbaung dynasty. One of Mindon Min's pregnant queens once had a craving for worms. Khotaung villagers, in response, dressed thick rice noodles with garlic oil, which eventually became Khotaung mont di.\n\nTaungoo mont di\nTaungoo mont di (\u1010\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1004\u1030\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e) is a specialty from the town of Taungoo. It is a rice vermicelli salad served with a thin mohinga broth, raw tomatoes and green beans, Burmese chickpea fritters, and fried garlic.\n\nYangon mont di\nYangon mont di (Burmese: \u101b\u1014\u103a\u1000\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e) is very similar to the Rakhine mont di. The only difference is that oil is added to the salad, reflecting the Burmese preference for oiliness.\n\nYodaya mont di\nDuring the 1700s, the influx of Ayutthayans following the Burmese\u2013Siamese wars to Mandalay also created an infusion Central Thai-inspired dishes, one of which is known as Yodaya mont di (\u101a\u102d\u102f\u1038\u1012\u101a\u102c\u1038\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e, lit.\u2009'Ayutthayan mont ti'). The rice noodle dish uses fish as the main protein instead of chicken, and is prepared using slivers of curled rice vermicelli strands (khanom chin) tossed in a turmeric-infused oil, and served with fried onions and raw green beans.

Others date it even further back to the Phoenecians.\nThe modern version of pasta salad that uses macaroni noodles dates back to 1914 in an American recipe.\n\nIngredients\nThe ingredients used vary widely by region, restaurant, seasonal availability, and/or preference of the preparer. The salad can be as simple as cold macaroni mixed with mayonnaise (a macaroni salad), or as elaborate as several pastas tossed together with a vinaigrette and a variety of fresh, preserved or cooked ingredients. Additional types of pasta may be used, such as ditalini. These can include vegetables, legumes, cheeses, nuts, herbs, spices, meats, poultry, or seafood.  Broccoli, carrot, baby corn, cucumber, olives, onion, beans, chick peas, peppers, and parmesan or feta cheeses are all popular ingredients in versions typically found at North American salad bars.\n\nOceanic commercial variation\nIn Australian and New Zealand cuisine, pasta salad became increasingly popular during the 1990s when commercial versions became more readily available in supermarket stores. It is made of cooked pasta pieces (usually either shell pasta, elbow-shaped pasta or penne) covered in mayonnaise and accompanied by carrots, capsicum (bell peppers), and sometimes celery.

The two traditional balsamic vinegars are made the same way from reduced grape must aged for several years in a series of wooden barrels, and are produced exclusively in either the province of Modena or Reggio Emilia. The names of these two vinegars are protected by the European Union's Protected Designation of Origin, while the usually less expensive Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (Aceto Balsamico di Modena) is made from grape must blended with wine vinegar, and produced exclusively in either Modena or Reggio Emilia, with a Protected Geographical Indication status.Balsamic vinegar contains no balsam or balsa.\n\nEtymology\nThe Italian word balsamico (from Latin balsamum, from Greek \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd, b\u00e1lsamon) means \"balsam-like\" in the sense of \"restorative\" or \"curative\"; cf. English \"balm\".\nUltimately from Ancient Hebrew-Phoenician \"\u05d1\u05e9\u05c2\u05dd\" (b\u0101\u015b\u0101m or besem, IPA [ba\u02d0\u02c8\u026ca\u02d0m]), the name means \"perfume or spice\", with the consonant sequence of the letter '\u03bb' and '\u03c3' deriving from Ancient Greek to pronounce the \u05e9\u05c2\u200e (\u015b) sound, sounding back then as [\u026c].\n\nClassifications\nThere are three protected types of balsamic vinegar:\n\nAceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena DOP\nAceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia DOP\nAceto Balsamico di Modena IGPMany products contain \"Aceto Balsamico di Modena IGP\" as an ingredient, such as glazes and other condiments.\n\nTraditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena DOP and Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia DOP\nOnly two consortia produce true traditional balsamic vinegar, Modena and neighbouring Reggio Emilia. True balsamic vinegar is made from a reduction of pressed Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes. The resulting thick syrup, called mosto cotto in Italian, is subsequently aged for a minimum of 12 years in a battery of several barrels of successively smaller sizes. The casks are made of different woods such as chestnut, cherry, oak, mulberry, ash and juniper. True balsamic vinegar is rich, glossy, deep brown, and has a complex flavour that balances the natural sweet and sour elements of the cooked grape juice with hints of wood from the casks.\nReggio Emilia designates the different ages of their balsamic vinegar (Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia) by label colour. A red label means the vinegar has been aged for at least 12 years, a silver label that the vinegar has aged for at least 18 years, and a gold label designates that the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.\nModena uses a different system to indicate the age of its balsamic vinegars (Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena). A white-coloured cap means the vinegar has aged for at least 12 years and a gold cap bearing the designation extravecchio (extra-old) shows the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.\n\nBalsamic Vinegar of Modena\nThese commercial-grade products imitate the traditional product. They are made of as little as 20% grape must (and not necessarily from Modena or Reggio Emilia), with the addition of wine vinegar, colouring, caramel, and sometimes thickeners like guar gum or cornflour to artificially simulate the sweetness and thickness of the aged Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena. IGP status requires a minimum ageing period of two months, not necessarily in wooden barrels, rising to three years when labelled as invecchiato (aged). As the manufacturing process is highly industrialized, the output of a medium-sized producer may be hundreds of litres per day.\nIn 2009, the European Commission inserted the Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (Aceto Balsamico di Modena) designation in the register of IGP productions.\n\nCondimenti that used the term balsamic\nCondimento (dressing) balsamic vinegars may be labeled as condimento balsamico, salsa balsamica or salsa di mosto cotto. For those products, there is a risk of creating confusion among consumers looking for the original Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI, the two different Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PDO, and Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia PDO.\nCondimento balsamic vinegar may be made in any of the following ways:\n\nMade by producers of both Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI or Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena/Reggio Emilia PDO, by using the PGI or PDO as an ingredient. For those products, the use of the PGI and PDO as an ingredient must be clearly reported, i.e. \"Glaze with Aceto Balsamico di Modena IGP\". The Consortium must approve the label and the use of the PGI's/PDO's name.\nMade by the same method as the vinegars, but by producers outside Modena and Reggio Emilia provinces and not made under consortium supervision. No reference to the PDO/PGI can be made for those products, and they cannot use the geographical names Modena or Reggio Emilia.As there are no official standards or labelling systems to designate condimento balsamic vinegar, it can be hard to tell their quality based on the packaging alone.\nExamples of Balsamic Condimentoi\n\nTraditional processes\nTraditional balsamic vinegar is produced from the juice of just-harvested white grapes (typically, Trebbiano grapes) boiled down to reach a minimum sugar concentration of 30% (brix) or more in the must, which is then fermented with a slow ageing process which further concentrates the flavours. The flavour intensifies over the years, with the vinegar being stored in wooden casks, becoming sweet, viscous and very concentrated. During this period, a portion evaporates: it is said that this is the \"angels' share\", a term also used in the production of bourbon whiskey, Scotch whisky, wine and other alcoholic beverages.\nNone of the product may be withdrawn until the end of the minimum aging period of 12 years. At the end of the aging period (12, 18 or 25 years), a small portion is drawn from the smallest cask, and each cask is then topped up with the contents of the preceding (next larger) cask. Freshly reduced cooked must is added to the largest cask, and in every subsequent year, the drawing and topping up process is repeated. This process where the product is distributed from the oldest cask and then refilled from the next oldest vintage cask is called solera or in perpetuum.\n\nUses\nIn Emilia-Romagna, tradizionale vinegar is most often served in drops on top of chunks of Parmigiano Reggiano and mortadella as an antipasto. It is also used sparingly to enhance steaks, eggs, or grilled fish, as well as on fresh fruit such as strawberries and pears and on plain crema (custard) gelato. Tradizionale vinegar may be sipped from a tiny glass to conclude a meal.\nContemporary chefs use both Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PDO and Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI  sparingly in simple dishes where the balsamic vinegar's complex tastes are highlighted, using it to enhance dishes like scallops or shrimp, or on simple pastas and risottos.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nConsortium for Protection of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena\nConsortium for Protection of Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena", "summary": "Balsamic vinegar (Italian: aceto balsamico) is a dark, concentrated, intensely flavoured vinegar originating in Modena, Italy, made wholly or partially from grape must: freshly crushed grape juice with all the skins, seeds and stems.\nThe term aceto balsamico is unregulated, but there are three protected balsamic vinegars: Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena DOP (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena), Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia DOP (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia), and Aceto Balsamico di Modena IGP (Balsamic Vinegar of Modena).

Cardini lived in San Diego but ran one of his restaurants in Tijuana to attract American customers seeking to circumvent the restrictions of Prohibition. His daughter, Rosa, recounted that her father invented the salad at the Tijuana restaurant when a Fourth of July rush in 1924 depleted the kitchen's supplies. Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of table-side tossing by the chef. Some recountings of the history state that Alex Cardini, Caesar Cardini's brother, made the salad, and that the salad was previously named the \"Aviator Salad\" because it was made for aviators who traveled over during Prohibition. A number of Cardini's staff have also said that they invented the dish.\n\nJulia Child said that she had eaten a Caesar salad at Cardini's restaurant when she was a child in the 1920s. In 1946, the newspaper columnist Dorothy Kilgallen wrote of a Caesar containing anchovies, differing from Cardini's version:\n\nThe big food rage in Hollywood\u2014the Caesar salad\u2014will be introduced to New Yorkers by Gilmore's Steak House. It's an intricate  concoction that takes ages to prepare and contains (zowie!)  lots of garlic, raw or slightly coddled eggs, croutons, romaine,  anchovies, parmeasan [sic] cheese, olive oil, vinegar and plenty of black pepper.\nIn a 1952 interview, Cardini said the salad became well known, in 1937, when Manny Wolf, story editor and Paramount Pictures writer's department head, provided the recipe to Hollywood restaurants.In the 1970s, Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves, which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers; coddled eggs; and garlic infused olive oil. Everyone makes the dressing a little differently and anchovy paste is sometimes added with Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard and garlic to enhance the flavor of the olive oil. Several sources have testified that the original recipe used only Worcestershire sauce without any anchovies, which Cardini considered too bold in flavor.Although the original recipe does not contain anchovies, modern recipes typically include anchovies as a key ingredient, which frequently is emulsified in bottled versions. Bottled Caesar dressings are now produced and marketed by many companies.\nThe trademark brands, \"Cardini's\", \"Caesar Cardini's\" and \"The Original Caesar Dressing\" are all claimed to date to February 1950, although they were only registered decades later, and more than a dozen varieties of bottled Cardini's dressing are available today, with various ingredients.\nAs the salad moved North to the U.S, a key ingredient changed within the recipe. Lemon juice is commonly used, despite the original Caesar salad opting for lime.\n\nCommon ingredients\nCommon ingredients in many recipes:\nromaine or cos lettuce\nolive oil\ncrushed garlic\nsalt\nDijon mustard\nblack pepper\nlemon juice\nWorcestershire sauce\nanchovies\nraw or coddled eggs\ngrated Parmesan cheese\ncroutonsVariations include varying the leaf, adding meat such as grilled chicken or bacon, or omitting ingredients such as anchovies and eggs.Vegan versions can replace anchovies with capers and the eggs with tahini.\n\nHealth concerns\nThere is inherent risk of infection by salmonella bacteria occasionally found in raw egg from cracked or improperly handled eggshells where the protective cuticle is damaged. Updated recipes recommend eggs that are briefly heated to 160 degrees or pasteurized eggs. Some variations of the dressing may use other substitutions for egg.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nJulia Child; Paul Child (1975).

Florence Hanna, the daughter of Italian immigrants and wife of restaurateur Ken Hanna, made large batches of her family's salad dressing for the house salads at the restaurant. The restaurant, originally called The '41 Cafe, later changed locations and became known as Ken's Steak House. The salad dressing became so popular that it was made in large vats in the basement of Ken's to keep up with demand. Customers started requesting the Italian dressing to go. The Crowley family, who owned a nearby manufacturing business, approached the Hanna family about bottling the popular salad dressing. This resulted in the creation of Ken's Salad Dressing, which now comes in ten different variations of Italian, as well as many other flavors.\n\nWish-Bone\nItalian salad dressing was served in Kansas City, Missouri, at the Wishbone Restaurant beginning in 1948. The Wishbone was opened in 1945 by Phillip Sollomi along with his mother, Lena. The Italian dressing served at the Wishbone was based on a recipe from Lena Sollomi's Sicilian family which was a blend of oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices. Demand for the salad dressing proved so high that Phillip started a separate operation to produce it for sale, making it by the barrel. The dressing recipe was eventually purchased by Lipton and has been made commercially by a succession of owners since, generating an entire Wish-Bone brand of products currently made by Pinnacle Foods, Inc.\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "In American cuisine, italian dressing is a vinaigrette-type salad dressing in that consists of water, vinegar or lemon juice, vegetable oil, chopped bell peppers, sugar or corn syrup, herbs and spices (including oregano, fennel, dill and salt) and sometimes onion and garlic. \nThe creamy Italian variant adds milk products and stabilizers.Italian and creamy Italian dressings are often bought bottled or prepared by mixing oil and vinegar with a packaged flavoring mix consisting of dehydrated vegetables and herbs.\nDespite its name, Italian dressing is not used in Italy, where salad is normally dressed with olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, salt, and sometimes balsamic vinegar at the table, and not with a pre-mixed vinaigrette.In North American cuisine, Italian dressing is also used as a marinade for meat or vegetables, for stir-frys, and on sandwiches.

It exists on a spectrum between Russian and Catalina dressing. French dressing is generally pale orange and creamy, while Catalina French dressing is bright red and less creamy. On the Mississippi Gulf Coast, it is a common practice to dip pizza in Catalina French Dressing. Common brands of French dressing in the United States include Annie's, Bernstein's, Dorothy Lynch, Heinz, Ken's, Kraft, Newman's Own, Marzetti, Wish-Bone.\n\nHistory\nIn the nineteenth century, French dressing was synonymous with vinaigrette, which is still the definition used by the American professional culinary industry. Starting in the early twentieth century, American recipes for French dressing often added other flavorings to the vinaigrette, including Worcestershire sauce, onion juice, ketchup, sugar, and Tabasco sauce, but kept the name. By the 1920s, bottled French dressing was being sold as \"Milani's 1890 French Dressing\", but it is not clear whether it included ketchup at the time. The modern version is sweet and colored orange-to-red from the use of paprika and tomatoes.\n\nRegulation\nIn the United States, French dressing was regulated by federal standards. Between 1950 and 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated French dressing to a standard with strict requirements of vegetable oil, vinegar, lemon or lime juice, salt, sugar, tomato paste or puree, and selected spices. On January 12, 2022, the FDA revoked the standard of identity and in the U.S. the ingredients can be at the choice of the manufacturer.In Canada, the Food and Drug Regulations of the Foods and Drugs Act state that French dressing must be prepared using a combination of vegetable oil and vinegar or lemon juice and the final product must contain at least 35 percent vegetable oil.\n\nSee also\nRussian dressing\nThousand Island dressing\nItalian dressing\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "French dressing, in consumer-facing American cuisine and store-bought products in the United States, is a creamy dressing that varies in color from pale orange to bright red.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Balsamico-1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Salad_Dressing-2_%2823044326320%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Sandwich_with_Catalina_dressing.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg"]}, {"pageid": 31535152, "title": "Ginger dressing", "text": "Ginger dressing (also called sesame ginger dressing or sesame dressing) is an American salad dressing made with East Asian ingredients and intended to evoke East Asian cuisine.

It is also popular in the United States and Canada as a dip, and as a flavoring for potato chips and other foods. In 2017, 40% of Americans named ranch as their favorite dressing, according to a study by the Association for Dressings and Sauces.\n\nHistory\nIn 1949, Thayer, Nebraska, native Steve Henson (1918\u20132007) moved with his wife to the Anchorage, Alaska, area, where he worked for three years in the remote Alaskan bush as a plumbing contractor. Endeavoring to keep his work crews happy, he invented a new salad dressing. Henson's success in the plumbing business enabled him to retire at age 35, and he moved with his wife to Santa Barbara County, California. After a year and half, the restless Henson, searching for some livelihood to occupy his time, purchased the Sweetwater Ranch in San Marcos Pass in 1956 and renamed it Hidden Valley Ranch. In creating the menu for the ranch kitchen, Henson served the salad dressing he had created in Alaska, which the guests enjoyed. Its popularity led Henson to mix a batch for his friend, Audrey Ovington, owner of Cold Spring Tavern, which became the first commercial customer for the dressing. By 1957, a packaged mix to make the dressing at home was being offered in stores.Henson began selling the packages by mail for 75 cents apiece, and eventually devoted every room in his home to the operation. By the mid-1960s, the guest ranch itself had closed, but Henson's \"ranch dressing\" mail order business was thriving. By the early 1970s, Henson realized that the operation was too big to keep running it at the ranch, which remained its corporate headquarters. The Hensons incorporated Hidden Valley Ranch Food Products, Inc., and opened a factory to manufacture ranch dressing in larger volumes, which they first distributed to supermarkets in the Southwest, and eventually, nationwide. The manufacturing of the mix was moved to Griffith Laboratories in San Jose, and the packaging was done in Los Angeles. The operation later moved to Colorado, and then in 1972 moved again to Sparks, Nevada. In October 1972, the Hidden Valley Ranch brand was bought by Clorox for $8 million and Henson went into retirement again.Kraft Foods and General Foods responded by introducing similar dry seasoning packets labeled as \"ranch style\".  As a result, they were both sued for trademark infringement by the Waples-Platter Companies, the Texas-based manufacturer of Ranch Style Beans (now part of Conagra Brands), even though Waples-Platter had declined to enter the salad dressing market itself over concerns that the tendency of such products to spoil rapidly would damage its brand. The case was tried before federal judge Eldon Brooks Mahon in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1976. Judge Mahon ruled in favor of Waples-Platter in a lengthy opinion which described the various \"ranch style\" and \"ranch\" products then available, of which many had been created to compete against Hidden Valley Ranch. Judge Mahon specifically noted that Hidden Valley Ranch and Waples-Platter had no dispute with each other (though he also noted that Hidden Valley Ranch was simultaneously suing General Foods in a separate federal case in California). The only issue before the Texas federal district court was that Waples-Platter was disputing the right of other American food manufacturers to compete against Hidden Valley Ranch by using the label \"ranch style\".Meanwhile, Clorox reformulated the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing several times to make it more convenient for consumers. The first change was to include buttermilk flavoring in the seasoning, meaning much less expensive regular milk could be used to mix the dressing instead. In 1983, Clorox developed a more popular non-refrigerated bottled formulation.\nDuring the 1980s, ranch became a common snack food flavor, starting with Cool Ranch Doritos in 1987, and Hidden Valley Ranch Wavy Lay's in 1994.During the 1990s, Hidden Valley had three child-oriented variations of ranch dressing: pizza, nacho cheese, and taco flavors.As of 2002, Clorox subsidiary Hidden Valley Manufacturing Company was producing ranch packets and bottled dressings at two large factories, in Reno, Nevada, and Wheeling, Illinois.\n\nPopularity and variants\nRanch dressing is produced by many manufacturers, including Hidden Valley, Kroger, Ken's, Kraft, Litehouse, Marie's, Newman's Own, and Wish-Bone. Commercial ranch often contains MSG and preservatives.\nIn the Southwestern United States, there is a variant from New Mexican cuisine called \"green chile ranch\" which adds green New Mexico chile pepper as an ingredient. Restaurant chains like Dion's produce and sell green chile ranch, as do others in the region.\n\nSee also\nList of dips\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHidden Valley Ranch Dressing history", "summary": "Ranch dressing is a savory, creamy American salad dressing usually made from buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, mustard, herbs (commonly chives, parsley and dill), and spices (commonly pepper, paprika and ground mustard seed) mixed into a sauce based on mayonnaise or another oil emulsion.

The caloric content of Italian dressing varies widely.\n\nHistory\nKen's\nNorth American style Italian salad dressing is thought to date back to 1941 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Florence Hanna, the daughter of Italian immigrants and wife of restaurateur Ken Hanna, made large batches of her family's salad dressing for the house salads at the restaurant. The restaurant, originally called The '41 Cafe, later changed locations and became known as Ken's Steak House. The salad dressing became so popular that it was made in large vats in the basement of Ken's to keep up with demand. Customers started requesting the Italian dressing to go. The Crowley family, who owned a nearby manufacturing business, approached the Hanna family about bottling the popular salad dressing. This resulted in the creation of Ken's Salad Dressing, which now comes in ten different variations of Italian, as well as many other flavors.\n\nWish-Bone\nItalian salad dressing was served in Kansas City, Missouri, at the Wishbone Restaurant beginning in 1948. The Wishbone was opened in 1945 by Phillip Sollomi along with his mother, Lena. The Italian dressing served at the Wishbone was based on a recipe from Lena Sollomi's Sicilian family which was a blend of oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices. Demand for the salad dressing proved so high that Phillip started a separate operation to produce it for sale, making it by the barrel. The dressing recipe was eventually purchased by Lipton and has been made commercially by a succession of owners since, generating an entire Wish-Bone brand of products currently made by Pinnacle Foods, Inc.\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "In American cuisine, italian dressing is a vinaigrette-type salad dressing in that consists of water, vinegar or lemon juice, vegetable oil, chopped bell peppers, sugar or corn syrup, herbs and spices (including oregano, fennel, dill and salt) and sometimes onion and garlic. \nThe creamy Italian variant adds milk products and stabilizers.Italian and creamy Italian dressings are often bought bottled or prepared by mixing oil and vinegar with a packaged flavoring mix consisting of dehydrated vegetables and herbs.\nDespite its name, Italian dressing is not used in Italy, where salad is normally dressed with olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, salt, and sometimes balsamic vinegar at the table, and not with a pre-mixed vinaigrette.In North American cuisine, Italian dressing is also used as a marinade for meat or vegetables, for stir-frys, and on sandwiches.

It is one of the four main types of vinegars in the Philippines, along with coconut vinegar, cane vinegar, and nipa palm vinegar. It is usually sold under the generic label of \"palm vinegar\".\n\nNames\nKaong palm vinegar is also known as sukang kaong or sukang irok, from kaong and irok, the native Filipino name for Arenga pinnata; and suk\u00e2 (with the Tagalog enclitic suffix -ng) means \"vinegar\". It is also sometimes known as sukang tub\u00e2, from tub\u00e2, the general term for palm toddy produced from various palm trees in the Philippines, including coconut, buri palm (Corypha elata), and nipa palm (Nypa fruticans).\n\nTraditional production\nKaong sugar palms (Arenga pinnata) are solitary monoecious palm trees usually found in riverbanks and ravines throughout Southeast Asia. They are used widely in maritime Southeast Asia for various products. In the Philippines, they are most commonly harvested for their fibers, leaves, fruits and their sap, which is used in the production of tub\u00e2 (palm toddy) in addition to vinegar. The palms become sexually mature and start producing large fruit and flower clusters at ten to twelve years, but sometimes they can flower as early as five to six years. They are difficult to farm and their propagation usually relies heavily on local wild populations of Asian palm civets (musang or alamid), which spread the seeds after eating the fruit.Sap can only be harvested from mature palms, as they are collected from the stalks of the male inflorescences. The flowers take a few months to develop. Before they are ready, the harvesters (mangangarit) climb the trees and shake the stalks daily to induce the flow of sap. Once the flowers bloom, the stalk is cut and a collecting container (usually bamboo) is placed over it. Harvesters climb the trees daily to collect the sap. They transfer it to special bamboo containers slung along one shoulder known as tukil.The sap are then poured into large earthen fermenting jars called tapayan. The sap relies on wild yeast to turn the sugars into ethanol. This turns the sap into a traditional palm toddy called tub\u00e2. Leaving it to ferment further, however, allows Acetobacter from the air to oxidise the ethanol to acetic acid. It is harvested once the level of acidity reaches four or five percent. The length of time it takes to produce nipa palm vinegar ranges from three to four weeks, though it is faster if a starter culture of yeast is used.\n\nModern production\nModern mass production of kaong palm vinegars add additional steps to the traditional process to standardize the acidity and sugar levels. The vinegar fermented in tapayan jars are pasteurized and then stored in food-grade plastic drums. They are allowed to age further for two months to three years before being bottled. Kaong palm vinegars contain benzoic acid, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium.\n\nCulinary use\nKaong palm vinegar tend to be sweeter and is the least sour among traditional Filipino vinegars. Like other types of vinegars, kaong palm vinegar is used primarily in dipping sauces (sawsawan). It can also be used in salad dressings as well as an ingredient in various dishes.\n\nOther countries\nSimilar vinegars are made in Indonesia and Malaysia from the kaong palm. But since kaong palm vinegar is a by-product of alcohol fermentation, it is not as widespread as in the Philippines and is restricted to Christian communities like in central and northern Sulawesi. Most kaong palm in Indonesia and Malaysia are cultivated for their fruits and fiber, as well as sugar (jaggery) production.\n\nSee also\nNipa palm vinegar\nBahalina\nBasi\nTapuy\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Kaong palm vinegar, also known as irok palm vinegar or arengga palm vinegar, is a traditional Filipino vinegar made from the sap of the kaong sugar palm (Arenga pinnata).

It is also sold by Mondel\u0113z International (formerly also Kraft Foods) as \"Miracel Whip\" throughout Germany. It was developed as a less expensive alternative to mayonnaise in 1933.\n\nHistory\nPremiering at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago in 1933, Miracle Whip soon became a success as a condiment for fruits, vegetables, and salads. Its success was bolstered by Kraft's advertising campaign, which included sponsorship of a series of two-hour radio programs. At the end of its introductory period, Miracle Whip was outselling all mayonnaise brands.According to Kraft archivist Becky Haglund Tousey, Kraft developed the product in-house, using a patented \"emulsifying machine\", invented by Charles Chapman, to create a product that blended mayonnaise and less expensive salad dressing, sometimes called \"boiled dressing\" and \"salad dressing spread\". The machine, dubbed \"Miracle Whip\" by Chapman, ensured that the ingredients, including more than 20 spices, were thoroughly blended.Another story claims that Miracle Whip was invented in Salem, Illinois, at Max Crosset's Cafe, where it was called \"Max Crossett's X-tra Fine Salad Dressing\", and that Crosset sold it to Kraft Foods in 1931 for $300 (equivalent to $5,300 in 2021). While stating that Kraft did buy many salad dressings, Tousey disputes the claim that X-tra Fine was Miracle Whip.Since 1972, Miracle Whip has been sold as Miracel Whip in Germany. It was formerly produced by Kraft Foods, and is now made by Mondel\u0113z International, in Bad Fallingbostel.\n\nIngredients and nutrition\nMiracle Whip is made from water, soybean oil, high-fructose corn syrup, vinegar, modified corn starch, eggs, salt, natural flavor, mustard flour, potassium sorbate, spice, and dried garlic. The original Miracle Whip is produced using less oil compared to traditional mayonnaise, thus has around half of the calories. Due to added corn syrup it is also sweeter compared to mayonnaise.\n\nAdvertising\nSix Flags announced a new partnership with the Miracle Whip brand in 2009.In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Miracle Whip attempted to appeal to younger audiences, with Miracle Whip advertising featuring prominently in the Electronic Arts video game Skate 3, including a dedicated trick, contest, and an achievement called Don't Be So Mayo. \nKraft paid Lady Gaga to include Miracle Whip in the music video for her song \"Telephone\". Television adverts described Miracle Whip as an alternative to \"real boring\" mayonnaise. Criticism by Stephen Colbert led to Miracle Whip buying ad time on his show, The Colbert Report, and attacking Colbert for being a \"mayo lover\". This also included publishing an open letter stating the attack was \"raising hell, man\". Eventually, this advertising was dropped.In 2018, the town of Mayo, Florida, temporarily changed its name to Miracle Whip as a promotional stunt.\n\nSee also\nSalad cream, a British creamy yellow condiment\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website", "summary": "Miracle Whip is a sauce condiment manufactured by Kraft Heinz and sold throughout the United States and Canada.

Founded in 1982 by actor Paul Newman and author A. E. Hotchner, the company donates all of its after-tax profits to charity through Newman's Own Foundation, a private nonprofit foundation which in turn supports child-focused programs.\n\nHistory\nThe brand started in 1982 with a homemade salad dressing that Paul Newman and A. E. Hotchner prepared themselves and gave to friends as gifts. The successful reception of the salad dressing led Newman and Hotchner to commercialize it for sale, financing it with $20,000 each as seed money. Afterward, they also produced pasta sauce, frozen pizza, lemonade, fruit cocktail juices, popcorn, salsa, grape juice, and other products. Newman's Own Lemonade was introduced in 2004 and Newman's Own premium wines in 2008. Each label features a picture of Newman, dressed in a different costume to represent the product.  The company incorporated humor into its label packaging, as in the label for its first salad dressing in 1982, \"Fine Foods Since February\". Many of the stories on the food labels were made up.\n\nIn 1993, Newman's daughter Nell Newman founded Newman's Own Organics as a division of the company, later to become a separate company in late 2001. It produced organic foods, including chocolate, cookies, pretzels and pet food. Her father posed with her for the photographs on the labels. In 2014, Nell's license with Newman's Own was not renewed, and Newman's Own Organics was transferred back to Newman's Own.Newman and Hotchner co-wrote a memoir about their company and the Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, Shameless Exploitation in Pursuit of the Common Good (ISBN 0-385-50802-6), published in 2003.  Newman and CEO Robert Forrester arranged for the continuation of the distribution of Newman's Own profits to charity after Newman's death through the establishment of the Newman's Own Foundation.Following Newman's death in 2008, control of the company and foundation passed to CEO Robert Forrester. Since taking over, Forrester has expanded and diversified the company. Newman's daughter, Susan, has alleged that Forrester had taken her family \"hostage\" and pushed them off the board of the Newman's Own Foundation, the body set up to distribute company profits to charitable causes. Forrester said that the company and foundation are continuing to be operated in accordance with the late Paul Newman's expressed wishes. Forrester's salary increased from $185,000 to $295,000 from 2010 to 2013. Forrester was fired in 2019 as a result of an internal review following allegations of inappropriate behavior, and the board appointed Jennifer Smith Turner as interim president and CEO. In January 2020, Dr. Miriam Nelson took over those roles, and the board finalized the positions in January 2021.\n\nCharitable funding and beneficiaries\nAccording to the Newman's Own Foundation website, over $600 million has been generated for charity since 1982. In 2016 the company donated profits of $30 million after gross sales of $600 million. The company co-sponsored the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award, which was presented annually to a United States resident who had fought courageously, despite adversity, to safeguard the First Amendment right to freedom of expression as it applied to the written word.\nA sampling of grantees is available at the Newman's Own Foundation website along with a description of funding areas.  One beneficiary of this charity is the SeriousFun Children's Network (previously the Association of Hole in the Wall Camps), residential summer camps and programs for seriously ill children, which Newman co-founded in 1988. Today, there are camps, programs, and initiatives operating across 5 continents. Over 1.5 million camp experiences have been provided to children and families free of charge.  While proceeds from Newman's Own helped finance the startup of the first camp, the network and its member camps now receive funding from many other sources. Additionally, Newman's Own Foundation also provided a grant to The MINDS Foundation to fund US operations of the non-profit that works in rural India. Other beneficiaries of the profits from Newman's Own have included The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund (from 1983 onwards), Shining Hope for Communities, Safe Water Network, Edible Schoolyard NYC, Fisher House Foundation, the WILD Young Women Programme (New Zealand), and Pilgrims Hospices (UK).\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nSeal, Mark (23 July 2015). \"Inside the family battle for the Newman's Own brand name\".

It is one of the four main types of vinegars in the Philippines, along with coconut vinegar, cane vinegar, and kaong palm vinegar. It is usually sold under the generic label of \"palm vinegar\".Nipa palm vinegar is listed in the Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods by the Slow Food movement. Along with other traditional vinegars in the Philippines, it is threatened by the increasing use of industrially-produced vinegars.\n\nNames\nNipa palm vinegar is known as sukang sasa or sukang nipa in native languages in the Philippines. Both nipa and sasa are the native names of the nipa palm in Tagalog; while suk\u00e2 (with the Tagalog enclitic suffix -ng) means \"vinegar\". It is also known as sukang Paombong after the town of Paombong, Bulacan where it is a traditional industry. The name of the town itself is allegedly from Tagalog bumb\u00f3ng (\"bamboo tube\"), the main equipment in gathering nipa sap before plastic or glass containers became prevalent. It is also sometimes known as sukang tub\u00e2, from tub\u00e2, the general term for palm toddy produced from various palm trees in the Philippines, including coconut, buri palm (Corypha elata), and kaong palm (Arenga pinnata).\n\nTraditional production\nNipa palm vinegar is gathered from mature nipa palms that grow in muddy soil beside brackish rivers and estuaries. The stalk of the nipa palm is cut and a container (traditionally bumb\u00f3ng, bamboo tubes) is placed underneath to collect sap. The harvesters traditionally shake or kick the base of the leaves as they collect the containers to induce the sap the flow. They may also sometimes bend the stalk. They are collected twice a day as they fill up, though it may take longer during dry seasons.The collected sap are placed in tapayan, large earthen jars traditionally used for fermentation. The sap relies on wild yeast to turn the sugars into ethanol. This turns the sap into a traditional palm toddy called tub\u00e2. Leaving it to ferment further, however, allows Acetobacter from the air to oxidise the ethanol into acetic acid. It is harvested once the level of acidity reaches four or five percent. The length of time it takes to produce nipa palm vinegar ranges from two to three weeks, though it is faster if a starter culture of yeast is used.Nipa palm sap has a relatively high sugar content, containing 15 to 22% sugar. This makes nipa palm vinegar slightly sweeter and less sharp than coconut vinegar. It is also slightly salty due to sodium content of the sap from the habitat of nipa palms. The vinegar when newly made is typically cloudy white. Due to the high iron content of the sap, the vinegar tends to turn orange to dark red as it ages. The vinegar also contains calcium, magnesium, and potassium. The sourness of the vinegar depends on how long it has been allowed to ferment.\n\nModern production\nThe production of nipa palm vinegar is usually associated with the town of Paombong in the province of Bulacan, where it is a prevalent local industry. However, it is also produced in other parts of the Philippines. The production of nipa palm vinegar is labor-intensive and it is predominantly only sold in local markets. Usually in roadside stands or by hawkers along with tub\u00e2 palm wines. Along with other traditional vinegars in the Philippines, which also have problems penetrating the national market, it is threatened by the increasing use of industrially-produced vinegars. Many nipa farmers are converting their nipa plantations into fish farms. It is listed in the Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods by the Slow Food movement.\n\nCulinary uses\nVinegar is one of the most important ingredients in traditional Filipino cuisine. Like other types of vinegars, nipa palm vinegar is used primarily in dipping sauces (sawsawan). It may also be sold spiced with ginger, garlic, and chili peppers (which are boiled beforehand). It can also be used in salad dressings as well as an ingredient in various dishes like paksiw and atchara pickles.\n\nSee also\n\nKaong palm vinegar\nBahalina\nBasi\nTapuy\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Nipa palm vinegar, also known as sukang sas\u00e2 or sukang nipa, is a traditional Filipino vinegar made from the sap of the nipa palm (Nypa fruticans).

Sour cream and yogurt are sometimes used in addition to, or as a substitute for, buttermilk and mayonnaise.\nRanch has been the best-selling salad dressing in the United States since 1992, when it overtook Italian. It is also popular in the United States and Canada as a dip, and as a flavoring for potato chips and other foods. In 2017, 40% of Americans named ranch as their favorite dressing, according to a study by the Association for Dressings and Sauces.\n\nHistory\nIn 1949, Thayer, Nebraska, native Steve Henson (1918\u20132007) moved with his wife to the Anchorage, Alaska, area, where he worked for three years in the remote Alaskan bush as a plumbing contractor. Endeavoring to keep his work crews happy, he invented a new salad dressing. Henson's success in the plumbing business enabled him to retire at age 35, and he moved with his wife to Santa Barbara County, California. After a year and half, the restless Henson, searching for some livelihood to occupy his time, purchased the Sweetwater Ranch in San Marcos Pass in 1956 and renamed it Hidden Valley Ranch. In creating the menu for the ranch kitchen, Henson served the salad dressing he had created in Alaska, which the guests enjoyed. Its popularity led Henson to mix a batch for his friend, Audrey Ovington, owner of Cold Spring Tavern, which became the first commercial customer for the dressing. By 1957, a packaged mix to make the dressing at home was being offered in stores.Henson began selling the packages by mail for 75 cents apiece, and eventually devoted every room in his home to the operation. By the mid-1960s, the guest ranch itself had closed, but Henson's \"ranch dressing\" mail order business was thriving. By the early 1970s, Henson realized that the operation was too big to keep running it at the ranch, which remained its corporate headquarters. The Hensons incorporated Hidden Valley Ranch Food Products, Inc., and opened a factory to manufacture ranch dressing in larger volumes, which they first distributed to supermarkets in the Southwest, and eventually, nationwide. The manufacturing of the mix was moved to Griffith Laboratories in San Jose, and the packaging was done in Los Angeles. The operation later moved to Colorado, and then in 1972 moved again to Sparks, Nevada. In October 1972, the Hidden Valley Ranch brand was bought by Clorox for $8 million and Henson went into retirement again.Kraft Foods and General Foods responded by introducing similar dry seasoning packets labeled as \"ranch style\".  As a result, they were both sued for trademark infringement by the Waples-Platter Companies, the Texas-based manufacturer of Ranch Style Beans (now part of Conagra Brands), even though Waples-Platter had declined to enter the salad dressing market itself over concerns that the tendency of such products to spoil rapidly would damage its brand. The case was tried before federal judge Eldon Brooks Mahon in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1976. Judge Mahon ruled in favor of Waples-Platter in a lengthy opinion which described the various \"ranch style\" and \"ranch\" products then available, of which many had been created to compete against Hidden Valley Ranch. Judge Mahon specifically noted that Hidden Valley Ranch and Waples-Platter had no dispute with each other (though he also noted that Hidden Valley Ranch was simultaneously suing General Foods in a separate federal case in California). The only issue before the Texas federal district court was that Waples-Platter was disputing the right of other American food manufacturers to compete against Hidden Valley Ranch by using the label \"ranch style\".Meanwhile, Clorox reformulated the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing several times to make it more convenient for consumers. The first change was to include buttermilk flavoring in the seasoning, meaning much less expensive regular milk could be used to mix the dressing instead. In 1983, Clorox developed a more popular non-refrigerated bottled formulation.\nDuring the 1980s, ranch became a common snack food flavor, starting with Cool Ranch Doritos in 1987, and Hidden Valley Ranch Wavy Lay's in 1994.During the 1990s, Hidden Valley had three child-oriented variations of ranch dressing: pizza, nacho cheese, and taco flavors.As of 2002, Clorox subsidiary Hidden Valley Manufacturing Company was producing ranch packets and bottled dressings at two large factories, in Reno, Nevada, and Wheeling, Illinois.\n\nPopularity and variants\nRanch dressing is produced by many manufacturers, including Hidden Valley, Kroger, Ken's, Kraft, Litehouse, Marie's, Newman's Own, and Wish-Bone. Commercial ranch often contains MSG and preservatives.\nIn the Southwestern United States, there is a variant from New Mexican cuisine called \"green chile ranch\" which adds green New Mexico chile pepper as an ingredient. Restaurant chains like Dion's produce and sell green chile ranch, as do others in the region.\n\nSee also\nList of dips\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHidden Valley Ranch Dressing history", "summary": "Ranch dressing is a savory, creamy American salad dressing usually made from buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, mustard, herbs (commonly chives, parsley and dill), and spices (commonly pepper, paprika and ground mustard seed) mixed into a sauce based on mayonnaise or another oil emulsion.

It is also documented in a 1910 catering book as an alternative to vinaigrette for dressing tomatoes or asparagus. A 1913 cookbook has a recipe which is a vinaigrette with paprika and mustard. A mayonnaise-based recipe is documented in 1914. The condiment came to be called \"Russian\" since the original recipe included caviar, a staple of Russian cuisine.Local historians claim that the mayonnaise-based version was invented in Nashua, New Hampshire, by James E. Colburn in the 1910s. A 1927 biographical article calls him \"the originator and first producer of that delectable condiment known as Russian salad dressing\".

It is typically served with fried fish.\nMarie Rose sauce is similar to Russian dressing, but with different piquant ingredients. It is typically served with seafood.\nA variant known as red Russian dressing is very much like Catalina or French dressing.In Germany, a similar salad dressing is called \"American dressing\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nHistorical definitions and recipes for Russian dressing", "summary": "Russian dressing is a piquant American salad dressing consisting of mayonnaise, ketchup, and other ingredients.\nRussian dressing is similar to Thousand Island.

Within that region, one common version of the dressing's origins says that a fishing guide's wife, Sophia LaLonde, made the condiment as part of her husband George's shore dinner. Often in this version, actress May Irwin requested the recipe after enjoying it. Irwin, in turn, gave it to another. In another, second version of the story, Thousand Islands summer resident, George Boldt, who built Boldt Castle between 1900 and 1904 and who was proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, instructed the hotel's ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Oscar Tschirky, to put the dressing on the menu in 1894 after he forgot dressing on salads and improvised with what ingredients were on hand at the time. A 1959 National Geographic article states, \"Thousand Island Dressing was reportedly developed by Boldt's chef.\" Despite claims that he was involved in the introduction of the salad dressing at the Waldorf, chef Tschirky did not mention the salad dressing in his cookbook that was published during that time period.When University of Wisconsin sociologist Michael Bell and his graduate students attempted to determine the origin of Thousand Island dressing in 2010, they found that the story differed among villages and islands in the Thousand Islands region. They discovered the existence of a third origin story in which the original recipe was based upon French dressing, which is supported by a recipe published in the 11th edition of The Fannie Farmer Cookbook (1965). All the claims appeared to be based upon oral traditions without supporting written records.According to Food & Wine magazine, the dressing was a traditional sauce from the late 19th century in the Thousand Islands region. The wealthy who visited the region carried bottles of the local sauce back to New York City, such as one variant found in Clayton, New York, called Sophia's Sauce found at a local hotel, Herald Hotel run by innkeeper Sophia Lelonde.Some food writers advance the claim that the dressing was invented by chef Theo Rooms of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago during the same time period.  The food historians at The Food Timeline point out that the earliest print reference to Thousand Island dressing appeared in 1912, and that recipes for different versions of the dressing begin to appear afterwards throughout the U.S.\n\nUses\nIt is widely used in fast-food restaurants and diners in the United States, where it is often referred to as \"special sauce\" or \"secret sauce\". An example of this is In-N-Out Burger's \"spread\", served on burgers and several \"secret menu\" items; despite its name, it is a variation of Thousand Island dressing. Thousand Island dressing is often used in a Reuben sandwich in lieu of Russian dressing. McDonald's Big Mac sauce is a variation on Thousand Island dressing.\n\nSimilar preparations\nRhode Island dressing (Rhode islands\u00e5s), introduced by the Swedish restaurateur Tore Wretman, is similar to Thousand Island and very popular in Sweden. Its name is confusing, especially for foreigners, and its origin unclear, since the dressing has no relationship to Rhode Island and the name is not used for preparations outside Sweden.\nIn Germany, a similar salad dressing is called \"American dressing\".\n\nSee also\nFry sauce\nMarie Rose sauce\nRussian dressing\nFrench dressing\nSalsa golf\nSauce\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThousand Islands: Thousand Islands Dressing early printed citations collected by Barry Popik", "summary": "Thousand Island dressing is an American salad dressing and condiment based on mayonnaise that can include olive oil, lemon juice, orange juice, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, vinegar, cream, chili sauce, tomato pur\u00e9e, and ketchup or Tabasco sauce.It also typically contains finely chopped ingredients, which can include pickles, onions, bell peppers, green olives, hard-boiled egg, parsley, pimento, chives, garlic, or chopped nuts (such as walnuts or chestnuts).", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Salad_Dressing-2_%2823044326320%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Thousand-Island-Dressing.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Thousand_Island_dressing_on_salad.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg"]}, {"pageid": 26682494, "title": "Traditional balsamic vinegar", "text": "Traditional balsamic vinegar (or aceto balsamico tradizionale) is a type of balsamic vinegar produced in Modena and the wider Emilia Romagna region of Italy. Unlike inexpensive \"Balsamic Vinegar of Modena\" (BVM), Traditional Balsamic Vinegar (TBV) is produced from cooked grape must, aged at least 12 years, and protected under the European Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) system, fetching higher prices.  (BVM has lesser protection under the European Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) system.) Although the names are similar, TBV and the inexpensive imitation BVM are very different.\n\nHistory\nA comprehensive study of the original production procedures, the aging conditions, and the sensory profile is not available.  This and the few and often-confusing documents make the reconstruction of the true history of TBV a challenge.\nThe term balsamico derives from the Latin word \u201cbalsamum\u201d and from the Greek word \u201c\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u201d, in the sense of \"restorative\" or \"curative\". The art of cooking the must of grapes dates back to the ancient Romans: it was used both as a medicine and in the kitchen as a sweetener and condiment.\nThe first generally accepted document referring to a precious vinegar produced in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia is the poem written in the 12th century by the monk Donizo of Canossa, although the word \"balsamic\" is never mentioned. The first testimonies clearly speaking about \"balsamic vinegar\", as well as of recipes and making procedure, appear from the 19th century even if little is known about the original recipes and related production practices. The adjective \"balsamic\" has been used to designate any kind of generically aromatic vinegar and products not just obtained from the fermentation of grape must alone.  As far as the aging method is concerned, it is very similar to the Solera system used in Spain after the Napoleonic Wars which spread abroad after the second half of the 19th century.The oldest and most detailed description of the method and techniques for the production of balsamic vinegar is reported in a letter written in 1862 by Francesco Aggazzotti to his friend Pio Fabriani, in which he describes the secrets of his family's \"acetaia\" (the vinegar-cellar where balsamic vinegar is made).\n\nLegal aspects\nTBV is produced in two different geographical areas of the Emilia Romagna Region so that two different designations were granted by the European Council, i.e. Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (TBVM) and Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia (TBVRE). \nThe two special vinegars are very similar products as the overall making procedure is the same; but, from a legal point of view, they are obtained according to specific and official production regulations defining (1) the basis of the vineyards ampelographic; (2) geographical area of production; (3) characteristics of starting materials; (4) making procedure; (5) the chemical, physical and sensorial requirements for sale; (6) bottling, labelling and presentation. The sensory profile of TBV is evaluated by hedonic\njudgment expressed through a numeric score. The sensory score achieved is used to rank TBV in different commercial classes. The specific regulations allow adding \"Extra Vecchio\" to the official designation when the product is aged for 25 years at least.  However, under existing regulations, neither the definition of \"aging\" nor the methods for its objective evaluation are specified; it is evaluated only through panel-tasting tests, whose effectiveness for this purpose is clearly inadequate. TBV results as a blend of vinegars of different composition and age due to the traditional making procedure. Actually, an easy-to-use mathematical method for evaluating the actual residence time of TBV within each cask of the barrel set has been recently published. This method is an adequate tool helping aging certification. An easy-to-use spreadsheet of the theoretical model is available for download.  At present, however, independent agencies that officially state TBV authenticity of both the TBVM and TBVRE haven't adopted it or any analogous procedure as an evaluation system.\n\nBasic technology\nMaking process of the TBV starts from freshly squeezed grape juice and finishes with sensory evaluation of the aged vinegar. From a technological perspective, basic steps are required, including cooking of the grape must, alcoholic fermentation by yeasts, acetic oxidation by acetic acid bacteria, and slow aging within a barrel set.\n\nCooking of the grape must\nCooking of the grape juice is carried out in open vessels directly heated by fire for 12 \u2013 24 hours reducing the grape juice by about 50%. The production regulations require starting from a grape must with 15\u00b0Bx at least to reach at the end of cooking 30\u00b0Bx for TBVRE; for TBVM, the lower limit is not specified. It is possible to find cooked musts with sugar concentration beyond 50\u00b0Bx. The operation allows profound chemical and physical modifications affecting the end quality of TBV. Cooking stops all enzymatic browning reactions that rapidly occur inside fresh grape musts by polyphenol oxidase and progressively promotes grape must discoloration due to the heat-induced deactivation of proteins including browning enzymes. In addition, cooking promotes nonenzymatic browning chemical reactions involving sugar conversion, formation of high molecular weight melanoidins and furanic compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Water vaporization induces the concentration of sugars, organic acids, and polyphenols, resulting in the increase of density, viscosity, and refractive index (Brix degree), and, conversely, the lowering of water activity and pH value.\n\nAlcoholic fermentation\nSugar fermentation and ethanol oxidation occur as a two-step biological transformation of the cooked must. The first requires anaerobic conditions and the second aerobic conditions. The two biological conversions occur inside a dedicated vessel, called the badessa. The alcoholic fermentation is carried out by yeasts belonging to a plethora of species and genera. In the past, the idea of a commensalistic interaction between yeasts and acetic acid bacteria existed, but recently the scalar fermentation has been suggested. The alcoholic fermentation is widely accepted to affect the end quality of TBV due to the several yeasts' metabolisms involved.\n\nAcetic bioxidation\nIn TBV, the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid in fermented cooked must is carried out by indigenous acetic acid bacteria naturally occurred in the environment. However, the application of selected acetic acid bacteria strains in TBV production has been recently proposed, and a procedure has been developed for the scale-up of the fermentation process at the vinegar factory scale. Bacteria involved in alcoholic dehydrogenation produce a wide range of compounds other than acetic acid, such as sugar acids and many volatile compounds. So, the chemical composition of TBV, relating to the AAB oxidation products, is highly variable and depends on several factors such as the type of grape must, cooking modality, oxidation temperature, and others. The acetification process and the growth of relevant bacteria are mainly affected by the alcohol, sugar, and acetic acid content.\n\nAging\nThe aging is related to two basic concepts. The first concerns the time that vinegar spends inside the barrel set (age or residence time); the second accounts for all time-dependent changes in chemical, physical and sensorial properties (physical ripening time).\n\nThe barrel set\nThe barrel set is a series of at least five wooden casks arranged according to a decreasing size scale, where the product undergoes profound changes over time. Casks may be of different wood types (e.g. oak, mulberry, ash, chestnut, cherry, juniper, and acacia), and the smallest cask volume ranges from 15 to 25 liters. Each cask has a hole on the top, the so-called cocchiume, facilitating the usual inspection and maintenance activities. The barrel set behaves essentially as a device for vinegar concentration due to water loss through the staves. As widely known for the wine production, it is reasonable to suppose that the wood acts as a semipermeable filter for the transfer of small molecules towards the ambient while it retains important volatile compounds such as the acetic acid. However, when the opening is not hermetically closed, the volatile compounds are lost preferentially through the cocchiume itself.\n\nRefilling procedure\nThe making procedure of TBV is a semicontinuous process requiring the annual refilling activity, consisting of withdrawing only a part of the vinegar from the smallest cask and topping it with the vinegar coming from the next cask along with the barrel set, and so on. The biggest cask receives new cooked and acetified must. This refilling procedure resembles the Solera method used for making sherry wine. \nThe purpose of refilling in the TBV making is to keep the vinegar volume constant inside every cask in the barrel set, and compensate for the volume drop caused by these three factors: TBV withdrawn for bottling, water evaporation, and possible vinegar leakages from the staves.\nRefilling involves the product flux-splitting from the biggest to the smallest cask, leading to the solute dislocation along the barrel set.\n\nAge and yield\nEach cask of a barrel set contains a blend of vinegars with different compositions and ages due to the refilling procedure. As a consequence, the mean age of vinegar can be calculated as the weighted residence time of the different aliquots of vinegars introduced through the years. A theoretical model has been recently developed to estimate the mean age of TBV requiring refilling, withdrawn, and casks volumes as input data. The refilling procedure imposes an upper limit for the residence time of the vinegar inside the barrel set.\nThe yield of a barrel set used for TBV production is easy to calculate by the ratio between the amount of TBV withdrawn (mTBV) and the amount of cooked must (mREFILLING) used to refill the biggest cask:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Yield\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              mTBV\n            \n            \n              mREFILLING\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\textit {Yield}}={\\frac {\\textit {mTBV}}{\\textit {mREFILLING}}}}\n  \nYield indicates the ability of a barrel set to concentrate cooked must at given operating conditions being dependent on the rate of water loss by evaporation. Low yields are due both to relatively low withdrawn and high water evaporation rates. The latter is the major factor lowering the TBV yield. The bigger is the evaporation rate, the higher is the flux of material through the barrel set and the lower is the residence time. As a consequence, when the yield is low, the vinegar age might be relatively low as a function of the amount of cooked must used to refill.\nApplying the spreadsheet of the theoretical model to a barrel set as in figure, the residence time obtained as a function of withdrawn quantity and evaporation rate is plotted in the concerning graph.\n\nChemical composition\nThe composition of TBV is very complex and not yet fully described. The classes of the major components are the sugars (mainly glucose and fructose) and organic acids (mainly acetic, gluconic, malic, tartaric, succinic acids). The classes of the minor compounds refer to volatile compounds and antioxidant molecules mainly polyphenols. An important class of minor compounds, recently investigated, is that known as melanoidins, an heterogeneous mixture of polymers arising from sugar degradation reactions activated during cooking of the grape must. These polymers contribute to many physical properties of TBV including colligative ones, the refractive index, density, specific heat capacity melt, and rheological properties.\n\nPhysical properties\nThe most relevant physical properties of the TBV are:\n\npH is usually lower than 3; it is a measure of the extent of carboxylic acids dissociation.\nDensity is usually intended as mass density at 20 \u00b0C, it cannot be lower than 1.24 g/ml (TBVM) and 1.20 g/ml (TBVRE); it is a measure of the extent of the solute concentration, as well as of water evaporation.\nRefractive index  is usually expressed with Brix scale and reaches on average 73\u00b0Bx.\nColor ranges from yellow/brown to brown/black during aging because of the accumulation of compounds, mainly melanoidins, from nonenzymatic reactions such as acid-catalyzed sugar degradation and Maillard reactions.\nViscosity  is a macroscopic measure of the degree of intermolecular interaction inside the vinegar bulk and is easily determined as the resistance to flow under controlled experimental conditions. The viscosity of TBV is on average around 0.56Pa\u22c5s and determines the TBV fluency as visually assessed according to procedures in use to assign sensory judgements.\nFlow index indicates the deviation of the flowing properties from the linearity (Newtonian behavior).\n\nTBV compared to BVM and other balsamic products\nFrom a legal point of view, TBV is categorized as 'food condiment', while BVM is a 'wine vinegar'. BVM can be produced without an aging period, whereas TBV gains its particular features during a long aging period fixed by law at no less than 12 years. TBV is the only condiment in the world produced starting from cooked grape musts without the adding of other substances, whereas BVM is a blend of concentrated grape musts, wine vinegars, and caramel (optional).\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nPDO Certification Production Rules\nVinegar Research Team of the Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences - University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy)\nVinegars and Acetic Acid Bacteria 2005 International Symposium\nThe Making of Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - Aceto Balsamico - Part 1\nThe Making of Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - Aceto Balsamico - Part 2", "summary": "Traditional balsamic vinegar (or aceto balsamico tradizionale) is a type of balsamic vinegar produced in Modena and the wider Emilia Romagna region of Italy.

Watergate salad is similar to ambrosia salad, which includes pineapple and marshmallows as part of its base ingredients, and whipped topping and nuts as part of its variational repertoire.\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the name \"Watergate salad\" is obscure. The recipe was published by General Foods (since merged into what is now Kraft Heinz) and called for two General Foods products: Jell-O instant pistachio pudding and Cool Whip whipped topping, a whipped-cream substitute. According to Kraft, \"There are several urban myths regarding the name change, but we can't substantiate any of them.\" Several competing explanations exist.\nKraft Corporate Affairs said: \"We developed the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight. It was in 1975, the same year that pistachio pudding mix came out.\" Kraft, however, did not refer to it as Watergate Salad until consumers started requesting the recipe for it under the name. \"According to Kraft Kitchens, when the recipe for Pistachio Pineapple Delight was sent out, an unnamed Chicago food editor renamed it Watergate Salad to promote interest in the recipe when she printed it in her column.\" Neither the article nor editor has been tracked down, however.\nThe Denver Post, in the Empire Magazine of June 27, 1976, published a recipe for Watergate Salad. It is sometimes said that Watergate salad was invented by a sous chef at the Watergate Hotel, and it was then served at brunch on most weekends. Watergate Salad took off in popularity during and after the presidential scandal which shares the same name. However, the Denver Post article does not verify this rumor, noting like most sources that the origins of the name are obscure.Syndicated household advice columnists Anne Adams and Nan Nash-Cummings, in their \"Anne & Nan\" column of October 9, 1997, reported that name came from the similar \"Watergate Cake\" (which shares most of the same ingredients): \"The recipes came out during the Watergate scandal. The cake has a 'cover-up' icing and is full of nuts. The salad is also full of nuts.\" Both cake and salad were part of a trend for satirically-named recipes such as Nixon's Perfectly Clear Consomme and Liddy's Clam-Up Chowder.In 1922 Helen Keller published a similar recipe, calling for canned diced pineapple, nuts, marshmallows, whipped cream and other ingredients. \"I ate it first in California, so I call it Golden Gate Salad\". Similar \"fruit salad\" and \"pineapple salad\" recipes had been published in the 1910s, and \"Golden Gate Salad\" was served in some American hotels.\n\nSee also\nList of salads\n\n\n== References ==", "summary": "Watergate salad, also referred to as Pistachio Delight or Shut the Gate salad, or colloquially as Green Goop, Green Goddess salad, Green Fluff, Green Stuff, or Mean Green is a side dish salad or dessert salad made from pistachio pudding, canned pineapple, whipped topping, crushed pecans, and marshmallows.

Jello salads were popular in the 1960s and are now considered retro.Because of its many elements, the result has speckled bits of interior color against a colored gelatin background, and so the dish can be appreciated for its colorful visual appeal. For example, a jello salad might have green from a lime-flavored gelatin, brown from nuts or pretzels, white from bits of cottage cheese, and red and orange from fruit cocktail. Therefore, it has a \"salad appearance\" (small pieces of food) although it is held firm in gelatin (like aspic). The \"salad\" theme is more pronounced in variants containing mayonnaise, or another salad dressing. When the dish has plain gelatin instead of sweetened gelatin, the use of vegetables is more common (e.g. tomato aspic).\n\nHistory\nThe name 'jello salad' comes from the genericization of the brand name Jell-O, a common gelatin product in the United States. The origins of jello salad can be traced back to a dish called 'perfection salad' (c.\u20091904) by Mrs. John E. Cook of New Castle, Pennsylvania, which won third prize in a Better Homes and Gardens recipe contest. Strawberry-pretzel and mandarin orange remain popular in the Midwest which are sweet alternatives for the original recipe.Jello salads are a common feature of US communal meals such as potlucks, most probably because they are inexpensive and easy to prepare. The salad has a strong regional presence in Utah and surrounding states (the Mormon Corridor), especially among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In Utah, where Jell-O is the official state snack, jello salad is commonly available in local restaurants such as Chuck-A-Rama.\n\nSee also\nAspic, a savory gelatin dish\nSeafoam salad, a type of jello salad\nFrogeye salad, a sweet pasta salad\nWatergate salad, dessert salad with pistachio pudding\nAmbrosia salad, a fruit salad\n\"Lime Jello Marshmallow Cottage Cheese Surprise\", a humorous song about a specific type of gelatin salad (1980)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nJell-O Salad with cottage cheese recipe", "summary": "Jello salad is an American salad made with flavored gelatin, fruit, and sometimes grated carrots or (more rarely) other vegetables.
