## Few-shot open-domain food classification from Wikipedia articles

The goal is to classify *arbitrary* images of food based on images & descriptions scraped from Wikipedia articles. Would be cool to take advantage of category hierarchies as well.

Currently have a rough implementation of [TIP-Adapter](https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/Tip-Adapter) and dataset gathering from Wikipedia. Parsing Wikipedia archives is probably a better idea than scraping, though.

Code is a bit messy.
